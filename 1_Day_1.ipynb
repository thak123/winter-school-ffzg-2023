trw com writes in article 930414 121019 7e4 rusnews w165w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes yes fortunately we have right thinking folk like your good self in power and it wa therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred thousand of iraqi in order to liberate oil h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news medium the fact are that le iraqi died in the gulf war than did civilian in any other war of comparable size this century let analyze this claim little how is the size of war defined by number of participant geographical area number of country involved number of casualty size of army duration number of casualty both absolute and a percentage of those involved geographical area and number of country too are all measure of size in this case d say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatant total troop compared to total casualty from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area which other comparable war are we talking about vietnam and korea might make good comparison which liberal news medium are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american mass medium cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war wa one of those poor poor iraqi along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bit this wa due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing technique which were technically possible only recently suspect that medical advance may have something to do with it too agree how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww2 don hear you bemoaning them perhaps because the topic hasn cropped up if you want my opinion think that the blanket bombing of german city at the end of world war two wa the most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country ha committed in century bomber harris wa no hero of mine perhaps so and maybe the atomic bomb wa mistake too but that easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90 right back then it wa all out war and germany and japan had to be squashed after all million or more british had already died hundred of thousand of french couple hundread thousand or so american and million of russian not to mention few million jew pole and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camp all thing considered the fire bombing and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to quick end to avoid even greater allied loss for one don regret it war is never an exact science but with smart bomb it becoming more exact with smaller percentage of civilian casualty sometimes mistake are made target are misidentified innocent die that war the way it really is entrenched political ruler operating in their own selfish interest without regard for the life of other people that is the way war really is sure and it the people who suffer because of them all the more reason to depose these entrenched political ruler operating in their own selfish interest or do you mean that this applies to the ally a well why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff couple of week before we started bombing make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner significant portion of the world oil supply he had to be stopped sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade and once he did so strong response from the west wa required mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like complete peace nik idiot although feel sure that wa not your intent what your intent to sound like loving christian well you aren doing very good job of it well it not very loving to allow hussein or hitler to gobble up nearby country and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain people under their dominion so d have to say yes stopping hussein wa the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest so the iraqi war wa wrong eh m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww2 eh who even mentioned appeasement and what make you think the situation is even remotely analogous to world war two mentioned it if we hadn intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement it is precisely the lesson the world learned in ww2 that motivated the western alliance to war letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww2 from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia guess we shouldn have fought ww2 either just think of all those innocent german civilian killed in dresden and hamburg yes do german are human too you know sure what wa truly unfortunate wa that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for thousand year reich the consequence stemmed from that tyrant like hussein have to be stopped his kind don understand diplomacy they only understand the point of gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people sacrifice not to mention the 357 american who died wa for naught look forward to hearing your incisive comment about east timor and tibet what should say about them anything in particular and a for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back verdict of not guilty yes amongst the thing thought were hmm there an awful lot of white people in that jury so it wa the policeman on trial not rodney king and under american law they deserved jury of their peer if there had been black officer involved m sure their would have been black juror too this point of allegedly racial motivation is really shallow those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and have not seen when see bunch of policeman beating someone who lying defenceless on the ground it rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it hard to imagine so when ha argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing logical argument can we expect another revision soon just kidding if there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret why not tell everyone what it is then everyone could say oh yes you re right king deserved good beating and we could all live happily ever after have to admit that wonder this too but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking so one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principal law in this country is intended to protect the right of the accused whether they be criminal or cop one is not found guilty if there is reasonable doubt of one guilt and only the jury is in position to ass the evidence and render verdict fine but m still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt wa in this case mean the cop certainly seem to be beating someone who lying defenceless on the ground what your explanation mass hallucination orbital mind control laser faked video footage do tell ok it certainly seemed to me that there wa excessive force involved and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too but then learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get conviction on charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm charge which news commentator said wa akin to attempted murder under california law based on what the prosecution wa asking for it evident that the first jury decided that the officer were not guilty note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm the seed of the prosecution defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could if the fact a the news commentator presented them are true then feel the not guilty verdict wa reasonable one mathew thou shalt not kill unless thou hast pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who get in the way a unfortunately it cannot be helped jim brown bible for loving christian thanks mathew like the quote pretty funny actually m monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already regard jim loving

terminater 2 and lawnmover man we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and computer graphic world magazine unfortunately while sgi system were used to create the special effect for both terminator 2 and lawnmower man those are film quality computer graphic rendered in software and written to film frame at time each frame of computer animation for those film took hour to render on high end parallel processing computer system thus that level of graphic would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time 30 frame per second we certainly want to know more about vr who are the leading company agency university what machine support vr e sgi sun4 hp 9000 bim 6000 etc it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual database at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frame per second this is similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulator for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notice the stepping of the frame a they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphic is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphic system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rate while rendering complex data representation additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system render 15 frame per second at one point then 60 frame per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what wa visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphic computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general doe not support real time operation but silicon graphic ha modified the unix kernel for it multi processor system to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management scheme uniprocessor system running unix cannot fundamentally support real time operation not sun sparc10 not hp 700 series system not ibm r 6000 not even sgi uniprocessor system like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge system support real time operation due to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from graphic perspective rendering complex virtual environment requires advanced rendering technique like

british go around blowing up skyscraper next don know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying 1 that the person accused of blowing up the wtc in ny actually did it and 2 that islamic teaching have something to do with blowing up the wtc wtc world trade centre which wa the building that wa blown up think okay to make some comment 1 the person ha only been accused innocent until proven guilty remember secondly there seem to be some hole in his accusation that read about for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid perhaps salamen wa one of those uneducated muslim we hear so much about nevertheless he wa apparently smart enough to put together very sophisticated bomb it doesn seem to fit together somehow actually salameh wa not the only person involved the other fellow wa chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive device in school believe it or not we actually allow radical muslim type to study thing like this in our university so much for the price of freedom from what read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb wa supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instruction _over the phone_ one must need some brain would expect despite this there have already been many attack and threat against mosque and muslim in the united state a consequence of his accusation have read k now please tell u where this is happening live in the s and have heard very little about these mosque attack there are many mosque in houston texas and would like to know what is going on so can verify this or is the great jewish medium conspiracy keeping u from knowing about this in the s we heard about the mosque attack during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now maybe it is localized to new jersey read this in an article in the australian muslim time the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this is true perhaps one of the muslim based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate 2 islamic teaching teach against harming the innocent in the qur an it explicitly teach against harming innocent even in time of war the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocent is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teaching this mean absolutely nothing plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious principle have seen people post many thing here from the koran which could be misinterpreted if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbeliever the first thing every muslim say is that no muslim could have done that because islam teach against harming innocent and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens what do you think is the consequence doe allah strike them down before the alleged violence occurs of course not muslim commit the violent act and then everyone hide behind verse in the koran we re pretty hip to that trick and even doubt that it will come up in the trial my defense is that am muslim and islam teach me not to harm the innocent therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir am muslim allah is all powerful allah would not have allowed this are you insulting my religion great defense eh just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslim in the world and stop hiding from that fact it doe no one any good to deny it it only make the more reasonable muslim look like they are protecting the bad one can you see that don deny this fact the thrust of my argument here is that salameh is according to u law innocent a he ha not been found guilty in court of law a his guilt ha not been established it is wrong for people to make posting based on this assumption islam teach u _not_ to harm innocent if muslim who perhaps have not realized that islam teach this perform such action it is _not_ _because_ of the teaching of islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teaching of islam this is an important distinction should clarify what muslim usually mean when they say muslim in general anyone who call themselves muslim and doe not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teaching of islam is considered to be muslim thus one who might do thing contrary to islam through ignorance for example doe not suddenly _not_ become muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teaching and essential principle though then one doe leave islam the term muslim is to be contrasted with mu min which mean true believer however whether muslim is in reality mu min is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu min used very much by muslim in alt atheism because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether for example am true believer or not for example could just be putting on show here and in reality believe something opposite to what write here without anyone knowing thus when we say muslim we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teaching by muslim we do not necessarily mean mu min or true believer in islam fred rice darice yoyo cc monash edu au',\n",

and john passage that lucifer wa ra created and that jesus wa not depends on particular interpetation of ra the word create one with which many christian may not agree ra granted the mormon belief that all of god child including christ ra and lucifer are eternally existent intelligence which were organized ra into spirit child by god the term creation can apply equally well ra to both of those passage just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to differing interpretation of create and say that many christian may not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of opinion also find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon belief you can grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that wa raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the bible state that lucifer wa created the bible state that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same ra your point that we all are brother of jesus and lucifer is also ra heretical since we are not innately brother and sister of

are so far removed from each other that to proclaim ra one a being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who died and left you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation don mean to be snotty about this ra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different ra group of biblical scholar what do you think of the jehovah ra witness for example that to make reference to the jesus of the ra bible is simply ridiculous whose jesus of the bible do you mean this is really red herring it doesn address any issue raised but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible doesn change what the bible teach for example the fact that the jehovah witness deny the deity of christ doe not alter what the bible teach looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ titus 2 13 simon peter servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with u through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ 2 peter 1 1 on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teach to discount or not even address what the bible teach because there are some group that have differing view is self defeating to see what the bible teach you have to look at the bible ra our lord mortality wa essential to his own salvation _the ra promised messiah_ 456 he had to work out his own salvation by ra doing the will of the father in all thing ibid 54 he had ra to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom _mormon ra doctrine_ 71 ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above book are by the late bruce mcconkie former general authority ra of the lds church those book were not published by the church nor do ra they constitute offical doctrine they consist of his opinion now ra doe that mean that what he say is not true not at all ll have to ra think about the idea of christ personal salvation before come to any ra conclusion myself the conclusion come to may seem heretical to ra you but m prepared to accept that find this rather curious when mentioned that the mormon belief is that jesus needed to be saved put forward some quote from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part is that no one addressed the issue of jesus needing to be saved rick come the closest with his have my own conclusion to addressing the point most of the other reply have instead hop scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his view were official doctrine don think that it matter if mcconkie view were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie writing indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be robert wei psyrobtw ubvms cc buffalo

constructing or analyzing an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job proposition or statement are the building block of logical argument proposition is statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday proposition may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false note that this is technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of word used to express it so god exists and there exists god both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the monty python sketch connected series of statement to establish definite proposition an argument consists of three stage first of all the proposition which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are called the premise of the argument they are the evidence or reason for accepting the argument and it conclusion premise or assertion are often indicated by phrase such a because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion a it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premise if something doesn seem obvious to you don be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation next the premise are used to derive further proposition by process known a inference in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other proposition already accepted there are various form of valid inference the proposition arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often denoted by phrase such a implies that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premise and inference conclusion are often indicated by phrase such a therefore it follows that we conclude and so on the conclusion is often stated a the final stage of inference for example every event ha cause premise the universe ha beginning premise all beginning involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe ha cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be premise in another argument proposition can only be called premise or conclusion with respect to particular argument the term do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusion might be stated first and the premise stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes little confusing recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premise or conclusion many people shower their writing with assertion without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe a an argument some statement look like argument but are not for example if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god this is not an argument it is conditional statement it doe not assert the premise which are necessary to support what appears to be it conclusion it also suffers from number of other logical flaw but we ll come to those later another example god created you therefore do your duty to god the phrase do your duty to god is not proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider statement of the form because if we re interested in establishing and is offered a evidence the statement is an argument if we re trying to establish the truth of then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this is an argument my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine this is an explanation there are two traditional type of argument deductive and inductive deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of it conclusion that is an argument where if the premise are true the conclusion must also be true deductive argument is either valid or invalid valid argument is defined a one where if the premise are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive argument are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other argument and about how probable their premise are there are form of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive argument a they are often viewed a the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that deductive argument is valid doe not imply that it conclusion hold this is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously valid argument can consist of true proposition however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false proposition for example all insect have wing premise woodlouse are insect premise therefore woodlouse have wing conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the argument premise are false if the argument premise were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach true conclusion from one or more false premise a in all fish live in the sea premise dolphin are fish premise therefore dolphin live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we cannot do is reach false conclusion through valid inference from true premise we can therefore draw up truth table for implication the symbol denotes implication is the premise the conclusion and represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference b b f if the premise are false and the inference t valid the conclusion can be true or false f if the premise are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t if the premise are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true sound argument is valid argument whose premise are true sound argument therefore arrives at true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid argument with sound argument to delve further into the structure of logical argument would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoided when constructing an argument these pitfall are known a fallacy in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken belief a well a to the faulty reasoning that lead to those belief this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing so for the purpose of this discussion we define fallacy a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely by studying fallacy we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of fallacy is not intended to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resort to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of conclusion it is often used by politician and can be summarized a might make right the force threatened need not be direct threat from the arguer for example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attack the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion doe not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it for example atheism is an evil philosophy it is practised by communist and murderer sometimes in court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of witness by showing for example that he is known perjurer this is valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it doe not demonstrate that the witness testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent particular circumstance for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animal for food how can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoe this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used a an excuse for dismissing the opponent argument this fallacy can also be used a mean of rejecting conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is bad thing you re white this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one adversary is rationalizing conclusion formed from selfish interest is also known a poisoning the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium mean argument from ignorance this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it ha not been proved false or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it ha not been proved true note that this is not the same a assuming that something is false until it ha been proved true basic scientific principle example of course the bible is true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomenon do not exist nobody ha shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy doe not apply in court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of it having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example flood a described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth doe not have tenth a much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the pole therefore no such flood occurred in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something ha not occurred we cannot conclude with certainty that it ha not occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known a special pleading the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of getting conclusion accepted for example did not murder my mother and father with an axe please don find me guilty m suffering enough through being an orphan argumentum ad populum this is known a appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to large group of people this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language for example pornography must be banned it is violence against woman the bible must be true million of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fool argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority us the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example isaac newton wa genius and he believed in god this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in particular field may be relevant to discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking ha concluded that black hole give off radiation and john searle ha concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinion on black hole radiation to be informed searle is linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when general rule is applied to particular case whose accidental circumstance mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one go from the general to the specific for example christian generally dislike atheist you are christian so you must dislike atheist this fallacy is often committed by moralist and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rule converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one form general rule by examining only few specific case which are not representative of all possible case for example jim bakker wa an insincere christian therefore all christian are insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter sweeping generalization occurs when general rule is applied to particular situation in which the feature of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable sweeping generalization is the opposite of hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known a false cause fallacy the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something a the cause of an event but it ha not actually been shown to be the cause for example took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared so god cured me of the headache the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event for example the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reason cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two event occur together they must be causally related and leaf no room for other factor that may be the cause of the event petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premise are at least a questionable a the conclusion reached circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes a premise the conclusion which one wish to reach often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be valid argument for example homosexual must not be allowed to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexual will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexual cannot be allowed to hold government office note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same a the conclusion an argument like the above ha actually been cited a the reason for the british secret service official ban on homosexual employee another example is the classic we know that god exists because the bible tell u so and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question presupposes definite answer to another question which ha not even been asked this trick is often used by lawyer in cross examination when they ask question like where did you hide the money you stole similarly politician often ask loaded question such a how long will this ec interference in our affair be allowed to continue or doe the chancellor plan two more year of ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument support particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teaching of christianity are undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teaching are true sadly such fallacious argument are often successful because they arouse emotion which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when key word is used with two or more different meaning in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that user can do what they like with it we must place license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premise used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is changed by altering which part of statement are emphasized for example consider we should not speak ill of our friend and we should not speak ill of our friend fallacy of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that property shared by the part of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass component and is therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that property of number of individual item is shared by collection of those item for example car us le petrol and cause le pollution than bus therefore car are le environmentally damaging than bus fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like it opposite it exists in two variety the first is to assume that property of some thing must apply to it part for example you are studying at rich college therefore you must be rich the other is to assume that property of collection of item is shared by each item for example ant can destroy tree therefore this ant can destroy tree the slippery slope argument this argument state that should one event occur so will other harmful event there is no proof made that the harmful event are caused by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have nation full of drug addict on welfare therefore we cannot legalize marijuana is based on fallacy is type of fallacy these fallacy occur when one attempt to argue that thing are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar example isn history based upon faith if so then isn the bible also form of history islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isn islam form of christianity cat are form of animal based on carbon chemistry dog are form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren dog form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form implies b is true therefore is true to understand why it is fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form implies a is false therefore is false again the truth table for implication make it clear why this is fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter ha the form implies a is false therefore is false where doe not in fact imply at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of doe not allow u to deduce anything about converting conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if then therefore if then argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that the way it always been argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employ constant repetition in asserting something bifurcation also referred to a the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one present situation a having only two alternative where in fact other alternative exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many question this fallacy occurs when questioner demand simple answer to complex question non sequitur non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premise which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone attention is diverted away from the point being made towards different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or question the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position ha been demolished it is fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual argument that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situation in an argument about general rule constitutes claim that those situation are analogous to each other this fallacy is best explained using real example from debate about anti cryptography legislation believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it such position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king are you saying that cryptography legislation is a important a the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu quoque this is the famous you too fallacy it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party ha performed it for instance you re just being randomly abusive so you ve been abusive too ÿ',\n",

world nntp posting host syndicoot engin umich edu in article 1993apr2 155057 808 batman bmd trw com jbrown batman bmd trw com writes why do baby get disease etc what god did create wa life according to protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into deep discussion of creationism v evolutionism here the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that am familiar with not only doe not support it but indicates something far different the earth by latest estimate is about 4 6 billion year old and ha had life for about 3 5 billion of those year human have only been around for at most about 200 000 year but the fossil evidence inidcates that life ha been changing and evolving and in fact disease ridden long before there were people yes there are fossil that show sign of disease mostly bone disorder of course but there are some heck not just fossil evidence but what we ve been able to glean from genetic study show that disease ha been around for long long time if human sin wa what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before human god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw and without getting sidetracked into the theological ramification of the original sin the main effect of the so called original sin for this discussion wa to remove humanity from god protection since by their choice e cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with god in addition their sin caused them to come under the dominion of satan who then assumed dominion over the earth deletion since humanity wa no longer under god protection but under satan dominion it wa no great feat for satan to genetically engineer disease both bacterial viral and genetic although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this uh know of many evolutionary biologist who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition it seems to adapt to it envionment in collective sense m really curious a to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code human dna being more complex tends to accumulate error adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is bad combination umm nah we seem to do pretty good job of adapting to virus and bacteria and they to u only very small percentage of microlife is harmful to human and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the rank keep changing for example bubonic plague used to be really nasty disease m sure you ll agree but it still pop up from time to time even today and doesn do a much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptom tend to be le severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variant overgrazed forgive the poor terminology m an engineer not doctor and died off for lack of nearby host could be wrong on this but from what gather acne is only few hundred year old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to be getting le nasty age hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial disease disorder now wait minute have question human were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan who making the disease would also gift human with the mean to fight them off simpler to make the disease le lethal if he want survivor a far a can see our immune system imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into u by god want to be clear on this are you saying that god wa planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that wa not at the time of design necessary that is god made our immune system ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendent would need to fight off disease this may be more of mystical supernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept but god is not responsible for disease even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook god protection here another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not perfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing masterpiece novel on bunch of gum wrapper held together with elmer glue that is the original genetic instruction were perfect but were written in inferior material that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better material wa god incapable of creating system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to deletion in summary newborn are innocent but god doe not cause their suffering my main point a said wa that there really isn any evidence for the

out the lukewarm in article c5jzz7 9g7 panix com ml panix com michael siemon writes well the whole point of making these the base commandment is that they aren reducible to rule set of rule is moral code or law code or an algorithm for acting such thing can be very helpful to individual or society but not if they are used instead of personal involvement in and responsibility for one action the two commandment are rule they are merely rule that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning michael siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turn on secular and cultural assumption that are independent of these rule the great commandment is more than anything else call to act a if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action the commandment to love your neighbor a yourself can be viewed in part a reminding man that he is not god and cannot act a if he ha ultimate responsibility indeed many tradition present an interpretation where believer are supposed to interpret loving one neighbor a following various other rule and relying on their god to make thing come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we are confronted with good sounding goo that mean whatever the reader want it to mean conservative may twist this act a if you were god to mean lay down rule for other people and be a nasty to them a possible if they don keep your rule they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy is how god act and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted there are many passage in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way michael cannot refer to base claim or base commandment to show that such reading are twisted because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base claim and commandment in addressing conservative christian michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notion that these conservative christian will reject but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our society is eager to hand u one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need principle for the critique of ethical system in which case will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again but these base commandment are too vague to serve a principle for the critique of ethical system the meaning of these base commandment for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notion that the believer brings to them from how the believer mix their demand with straightforward reading of other biblical passage from particular sectarian tradition or from some combination of these thing these commandment lack sufficient substance in themself to serve a basis for criticizing ethical system what meaning they have come from the ethical system the believer brings to these commandment and different body of christian have from the beginning urged different ethical system or in some case none a result it is bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamous with christianity christianity doe not have torah it doe not have qu ran specifically christian scripture ha very little if anything in the way of commandment so little that the christian who desperately want commandment go mining for them with almost no support the one single thing in the gospel which jesus specifically give a commandment to u is love one another jesus explicitly state that this summarizes jewish law which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it mean to love god and love our neighbor there are many parable and teaching the gospel attribute to jesus that are straightforwardly read a ethical commandment the pauline epistle are similarly full if it is not clear that these all come together in sensible understanding of ethical behavior the problem is not lack of raw material am radical christian only in that take the gospel seriously no michael the conservative christian also take the gospel seriously what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel why don i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you something about christianity in sense the wide variety of interpretation doe tell u something about christianity it tell u that the new testament author left sufficiently vague hodge podge that it can serve a the source text for many vastly different belief about the nature of the christian god and about what men should and shouldn do the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbian and gay every christian principle he turn to this cause is effective only through the extra christian principle through which michael interprets his religion and the homophobe apply the same christian principle with equal justification to their cause in short it is the extra christian principle that make michael christianity beneficial and suspect they would be a beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by christian interpretation michael paint picture of standard american atheism a the rejection of the evil in many conservative christian interpretation of the bible but think it is even more damaging to christianity to note that the new testament present such vague hodge podge of notion about the nature of god and the nature of the good except of course when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principle here think we should apply christian parable where cold drink can have it value and hot drink can have it value but the lukewarm we should spit out

orbiter mariner 1 the first s attempt to send spacecraft to venus failed minute after launch in 1962 the guidance instruction from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to problem with it antenna so the onboard computer took control however there turned out to be bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it wa actually transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing wa omitted from the expression dot bar sub nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variation of velocity a if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that venus is very hot 800 degree fahrenheit now revised to 900 degree world with cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid wa later confirmed in 1978 mariner 3 launched on november 5 1964 wa lost when it protective shroud failed to eject a the craft wa placed into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun energy for power from it solar panel the probe soon died when it battery ran out and is now in solar orbit it wa intended for mar flyby with mariner 4 mariner 4 the sister probe to mariner 3 did reach mar in 1965 and took the first close up image of the martian surface 22 in all a it flew by the planet the probe found cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientist concluded from this preliminary scan that mar wa dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner 5 wa sent to venus in 1967 it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five year earlier by mariner 2 plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at it surface is at least 90 time that of earth or the equivalent of being 3 300 foot under the surface of an ocean mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mar in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by mariner 4 four year earlier however they failed to take away the concept of mar a dead planet first made from the basic measurement of mariner 4 mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner 9 the sister probe to mariner 8 became the first craft to orbit mar in 1971 it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcano on the martian surface a well a giant canyon system and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup image of mar two small moon phobos and deimos mariner 10 used venus a gravity assist to mercury in 1974 the probe did return the first close up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen detail in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four earth day mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury a heavily cratered world with mass much greater than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury ha an iron core which make up 75 percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiter pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon including new data on the van allen radiation belt circling earth all three craft had failure with their rocket launcher pioneer 1 wa launched on october 11 1958 pioneer 2 on november 8 and pioneer 3 on december 6 pioneer 4 wa moon probe which missed the moon and became the first s spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959 pioneer 5 wa originally designed to flyby venus but the mission wa scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to 36 2 million kilometer in 1960 record until mariner 2 pioneer 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 pioneer 6 7 and 8 are still transmitting information at this time pioneer would have been number 10 suffered launch failure in 1969 pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973 pioneer 11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in 1979 both vehicle should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus 1 1978 also known a pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer 12 burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8 1992 pvo made the first radar study of the planet surface via probe pioneer venus 2 also known a pioneer 13 sent four small probe into the atmosphere in december of 1978 the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probe descended by parachute towards the surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day probe did make it and transmitted for 67 5 minute on the ground before it battery failed ranger lunar lander and impact mission ranger 1 and 2 were test probe for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problem left them in useless low orbit which quickly decayed ranger 3 launched on january 26 1962 wa intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problem during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger 3 did try to take some image of the moon a it flew by but the camera wa unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 had the same purpose a ranger 3 but suffered technical problem enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first s probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4 lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar mission they were to send back live image of the lunar surface a they headed towards an impact with the moon ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when it camera did not operate ranger 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first s lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through 1965 lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image various site being studied a landing area for the manned apollo mission of 1969 1972 the probe also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were essentially successful in their mission they were the first s probe to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it wa feared by some that the moon wa covered in great layer of dust which would not support heavy landing vehicle surveyor wa successful in proving that the lunar surface wa strong enough to hold up spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful mission the rest became the first s probe to soft land on the moon taking thousand of image and scooping the soil for analysis apollo 12 landed 600 foot from surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned part of the craft to earth surveyor 7 the last of the series wa purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in 1968 viking mar orbiter and lander viking 1 wa launched from cape canaveral florida on august 20 1975 on titan 3e centaur d1 rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june 19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slope of chryse planitia on july 20 1976 it soon began it programmed search for martian micro organism there is still debate a to whether the probe found life there or not and sent back incredible color panorama of it surroundings one thing scientist learned wa that mar sky wa pinkish in color not dark blue a they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among field of red sand and boulder stretching out a far a it camera could image the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7 1980 when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander wa switched into weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994 but after november 13 1982 an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further order communication wa never regained again despite the engineer effort through may of 1983 an interesting side note viking 1 lander ha been designated the thomas mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington c is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by manned expedition viking 2 wa launched on september 9 1975 and arrived in martian orbit on august 7 1976 the lander touched down on september 3 1976 in utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same task a it sister lander with the exception that it seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had series of attitude control gas leak in 1978 which prompted it being shut down that july the lander wa shut down on april 12 1980 the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around 2025 voyager outer planet flybys voyager 1 wa launched september 5 1977 and flew past jupiter on march 5 1979 and by saturn on november 13 1980 voyager 2 wa launched august 20 1977 before voyager 1 and flew by jupiter on august 7 1979 by saturn on august 26 1981 by uranus on january 24 1986 and by neptune on august 8 1989 voyager 2 took advantage of rare once every 189 year alignment to slingshot it way from outer planet to outer planet voyager 1 could in principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing of titan close up between the two probe our knowledge of the 4 giant planet their satellite and their ring ha become immense voyager 1 2 discovered that jupiter ha complicated atmospheric dynamic lightning and aurora three new satellite were discovered two of the major surprise were that jupiter ha ring and that io ha active sulfurous volcano with major effect on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probe reached saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlet and 7 satellite including the predicted shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable the weather wa tame compared with jupiter massive jet stream with minimal variance 33 year great white spot band cycle is known titan atmosphere wa smoggy mimas appearance wa startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here wa the stranger aspect of the ring braid kink and spoke were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming effort continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself wa highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity wa that it magnetic axis wa found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus peculiar magnetosphere icy channel were found on ariel and miranda wa bizarre patchwork of different terrain 10 satellite and one more ring were discovered in contrast to uranus neptune wa found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud feature the ring arc turned out to be bright patch on one ring two other ring and 6 other satellite were discovered neptune magnetic axis wa also skewed triton had canteloupe appearance and geyser what liquid at 38k the two voyager are expected to last for about two more decade their on target journeying give negative evidence about possible planet beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary mission since there have been so many soviet probe to the moon venus and mar will highlight only the primary mission

vega 2 first balloon probe of venusian atmosphere in 1985 including two lander flyby bus went on to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close up in march of 1986 soviet mar probe mar 1 first acknowledged mar probe in 1962 transmission ceased enroute the following year zond 2 first possible attempt to place lander capsule on martian surface probe signal ceased enroute in 1965 mar 2 first soviet mar probe to land albeit crash on martian surface orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red planet in 1971 mar 3 first successful soft landing on martian surface but lander signal ceased after 90 second in 1971 mar 4 attempt at orbiting mar in 1974 braking rocket failed to fire probe went on into solar orbit mar 5 first fully successful soviet mar mission orbiting mar in 1974 returned image of martian surface comparable to s probe mariner 9 mar 6 landing attempt in 1974 lander crashed into the surface mar 7 lander missed mar completely in 1974 went into solar orbit with it flyby bus phobos 1 first attempt to land probe on surface of mar largest moon phobos probe failed enroute in 1988 due to human computer error phobos 2 attempt to land probe on martian moon phobos the probe did enter mar orbit in early 1989 but signal ceased one week before scheduled phobos landing while there ha been talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probe within the next thirty year no major step have yet been taken with these project more intensive study of the moon mar venus and various comet have been planned for the 1990s and mercury mission to orbit and land probe on the tiny world ha been planned for 2003 how the many change in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent state will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen japanese planetary mission sakigake m t5 wa launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january 8 1985 and approached halley comet within about 7 million km on march 11 1986 the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma wave solar wind all of which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth the closest approach wa at 23h08m47s jst utc 9h on january 8 1992 the geocentric distance wa 88 997 km this is the first planet swingby for japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail passage will be scheduled in some year hence the second earth swingby will be on june 14 1993 at 40 re earth radius and the third october 28 1994 at 86 re hiten small lunar probe wa launched into earth orbit on january 24 1990 the spacecraft wa then known a mus but wa renamed to hiten once in orbit the 430 lb probe looped out from earth and made it first lunary flyby on march 19 where it dropped off it 26 lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to orbit satellite around the moon joining the unites state and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientist to lose track of it hagoromo rocket motor fired on schedule on march 19 but the spacecraft tracking transmitter failed immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo wa optically confirmed using the schmidt camera 105 cm f3 1 at the kiso observatory in japan hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly interval and performed aerobraking experiment using the earth atmosphere hiten made close approach to the moon at 22 33 jst utc 9h on february 15 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon surface 35 3n 9 7e and fired it propulsion system for about ten minute to put the craft into lunar orbit the following is the orbital calculation result after the approach apoapsis altitude about 49 400 km periapsis altitude about 9 600 km inclination 34 7 deg to ecliptic plane period 4 7 day planetary mission reference also recommend reading the

mcclary netcom com michael mcclary writes just thought d clear up few of the murky area actually after surviving being driven out of nauvoo and later carthage the mormon did fortify utah they still arm themselves to defend the faith and stockpile food a well they have been involved in quite lot of illegal activity including multiple and often underage wife for the leader practice still in vogue with some splinter of their sect the parallel between koresh and joseph smith are striking by they you mean the leader of the lds church grant you that when joseph smith wa still alive plenty of accusation were filed most of which had little bearing with reality a evidenced by various verdict have studied lds history for 15 year now and have yet to see prove that the lds leadership wa involved in quote illegal activity plural marriage yes but your charge of underage wife sound like it could have originated from tabloid and discredit the high moral standard which characterized these leader and family unlike a it appears those of david koresh joseph smith started the sect after he and his brother hyram were murdered in nauvoo il jail cell church membership split over who to follow initially smith wa considered prophet just like mohammed rather interesting parallel considering muslim consider christ to be prophet the same a jew m led to understand make no mistake this wa no messiah we re talking about in smith the and neither did he claim he wa a the church reflects the moral aptitude of it leader and especially those of joseph smith have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man whose only crime wa that he refused to deny that he had seen vision many have tried to explain the smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an 8 5 million member strong church stand a witness that joseph smith testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message thought at the time wa that the gift of prophecy wa to be handed down father to son after joseph smith died his son wa only entering his teen brigham young and few others claimed to have been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death the council of twelve the church governing body wasn of much help here and this basic conflict is still wedge between the sect brigham young took his follower to salt lake the rest waited for smith jr to grow up enough to assume leadership the other claimant to the leadership were soon ignored like mike dukakis the rest were apostate and excommunicated member of the church while the great majority of the membership the twelve and the various auxiliary organization chose to accept brigham young a the new prophet and leader of the church if you knew your lds scripture and doctrine you would have known that brigham young wa the first in line to fill the prophet joseph smith vacancy he wa the senior apostle in the quorum and various comment made by joseph indicated that it wa brigham who would lead the latter day exodus to the west other rightful heir were either dead hyrum smith or excommunicated oliver cowdery and while persecution abounded and intensified joseph smith had already given order to look for new place an empty land beyond the boundary of the united state at that time this rekhabite principle pseudographia wa well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful and wa not questioned by them granted couple of do it yourselfers stayed behind unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown but this also wa necessary to separate the tare from the wheat the church benefitted from this purification process they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world both sect practiced the 1 year food stockpile doctrine and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at least owned weapon there is little evidence that they were militaristic sect given that they tended to move on rather than face large scale opposition brigham young having suffered great deal getting to salt lake seems to have been quite justified in making military training good thing remember this wa far beyond where even the u army went and these people had nobody to turn to save themselves just little context to put this all in perspective btw since when is the church of jesus christ of latter day saint one of the largest denomination in the country sect it didn splinter from any other religion a did say the southern baptist or methodist so what did the mormon get it seems that edgar hoover wa very impressed with the way they kept secret they re pledged to defend secret with their life and atone for sin with blood many actually do even to the point of suicide what balloney suicide is sinful and against the law of god am not comfortable with this alleged cosiness with mammon assure you that many among u reject this attitude categorically period our only true allegiance is to our god and to the leader which he ha appointed to represent him in any regard to read this trash about suicide and atone for sin with blood is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church belief in and stand for the rlds the reorganized lds are friendly rival of the lds and delight in telling story about them which generates quick retort from the lds member and everybody ha grand time at no time have ever even heard this hinted at m taking it with salt block make it really big salt mountain with glacier on top so he hired virtually no one but mormon until the fbi wa almost exclusively staffed by member of the church of later day saint though edgar is finally gone the fbi personnel especially the field agent are still heavily mormon have often wondered how this might affect the fbi treatment of religious organization mormon would consider heretical preposterous even if this were true reliable data please am convinced that those officer would perform to the highest code of honor and conduct that why they were selected for in the first place remember besides one of our article of faith strongly state the principle of freedom of religion and that all people are free to worship how where or what they may if it true there would be little affect lds and rlds philosophy is that all other religion have strayed from the true church a set down by jesus but that god will judge each on his own merit in addition the rlds also contend and the lds may a well that ignorance of the true way tm is an excuse you can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected it in short lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutheran to buddhist secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they will not be penalized for ignorance it is more likely that hoover liked them because of their rather strict upbringing which forbade alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like these people are the salt of the earth and a such are more easily made to follow order and have few vice to be used against them good explanation can accept that you are right that lds people are sometimes little too cosy with mammon order the late president kimball for example wa an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the mx peace keeper missile maze in utah that my somewhat educated guess anyway both sect have splinter group that don mirror the mass but these are small and rare and hardly worth noting their common ancestry none of this ha any relevance to gun though when man religion is used to deny him the right of self protection with the weapon suitable for the job he ll find

light ha come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deed are evil everyone who doe evil hate the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deed will be exposed kent sandvik say it seems we are dealing with black and white interpretation brian are you subtly accusing me of evil thing because never saw the light however this is even more confusing because even admit that don like the situation where m not informed black and white spade is spade there is no hidden agenda behind this so stop trying to look for one it is an easy and a straight forward a it read kent am not accusing you of evil thing jesus is accusing you and it is not only you that he is accusing he is accusing everyone me you and everyone in the world is guilty whether one see the light or doe not seen the light ha nothing to do with whether we do evil thing we do them regardless jesus us the word men am included jesus is not soloing you out jesus is making general statement about out the sad state of man christian are not immuned from doing evil thing christian is just person in whom the holy spirit indwells christian can see the evil he is doing because his evil ha been brought out into the light jesus is not saying that just because evil ha been exposed that the christian will stop doing evil if you haven seen jesus light your evil deed simply haven been exposed to the his light you may shed some light on your own your human spirit shine at perhaps 1 candela but the holy spirit shine at megacandela the holy spirit can shine light into place inside u where we didn even know existed so do you see jesus point christian are not perfect nonchristians are not perfect nonchristians do not want to come into the light of jesus because they will see all the problem in their life and they will not like the sight it is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from jesus perspective do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are do you think brian kendig want to know do you think want to know ego verse the truth which do you choose m watching the news about man who saw the light and made sure that the 19 child burned to death a part of his insight into the light don think the world is that simple and if you act in such way when you are enlighted then m happy man and pray will never receive such light and watched koresh too an imposter who thought he saw the light who made sure that the 19 child burned to death sadly a part of his delusion it is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them and that ignorance wa their downfall to death and kent don you bury yourself underneath rock with an excuse like bringing up koresh a if koresh actually had truth in him david koresh wa no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real jesus christ david koresh who claimed to be jesus wa fraud it wa obvious david koresh wa born in america jesus wa born in bethlehem koresh wasn even good imposter having missed an obvious point a that jesus warned of such imposter in the end time david koresh wasn anything new to jesus jesus told u to be aware of imposter 2000 year ago so the next time an imposter make scene and claim to be jesus ask the obvious where were you born wa your mother name mary if the branch davidians asked that simple question they would have labeled koresh liar right from the start the wouldn have followed koresh they wouldn have died but look what happened their ignorance cost them their life their choice to be ignorant cost them lot kent since you studied the bible under lutheranism do you not remember what tactic satan used to try to tempt jesus did not satan quote the bible out of context do you remember what tactic the serpent of genesis used to tempt eve did he not misquote god what satan used on eve and succeeded wa the same ploy he tried on jesus but in jesus case jesus rebuked satan back with the bible _in_ context it didn work with jesus doe what satan did to eve in the garden and what satan tried to do with jesus in the desert remind you of what koresh did to his follower who did koresh emulate who wa koresh teacher koresh did to his follower what satan did to eve did not koresh kill his followersr did not satan cause adam and eve to die a well did not the cult follower believe koresh even though they knew the real christ wa born in bethlehem did not eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death god held them all responsible deceiver and the rebeller none of them had an excuse a opposed to the branch davidians we have second chance follow jesus and he will escort u to the path of eternal life don follow jesus and you stand condemned already for like the branch davidian complex your house is already on fire satan adam and eve have already set it ablaze it is just slow burn but it is burning nevertheless',\n",

u and then myself the dark one wa in the process of making the others into god he had to teach them what that meant by advising them in their past basically he manipulated them into reproducing and raising their child on his seed he said that the little one who looked different were sub specie meant to provide service he carefully combed through history rewriting it in his favor pulling like weed anything that compromised his control he enticed recruit by sending them his vision saying that there wa immortality at the end of the road for only twelve soul kill or be killed the amount of control he could exert wa finite though a at every change he made void would appear in our reality the universe one day ended 100 meter from u it seemed odd but we couldn remember how else it should be then some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertip he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he

liar lunatic or the real thing might be little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he wa part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became christian himself assume you are posting to encourage comment how much history ha tony campello read not much it seems the arguements he us am summing up the book is about whether jesus wa god or not know many of you don believe but listen to different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to say it is good to hear that there are few reasonable christian about if only those christian scientist would take note in australia there is very strong movement bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the law of physic for example there are few chap who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 year old and that the error in conventional calculation is the result of the fact that the speed light ha been rapidly decaying over the year and this ha not been accounted for the book say that jesus wa either liar or he wa crazy modern day koresh or he wa actually who he said he wa or of course that he never existed and the bible wa story and wa never intended to become manifesto for billion people did tony follow that one up some reason why he wouldn be liar are a follows who would die for lie wouldn people be able to tell if he wa liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who wa or had been healed million of people have died for lie this point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined great many religious argument work in that way but consider the many aztec warrior who sacrificed themselves to their god in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invader the list is endless the aztec lost btw call me fool but believe he did heal people that is perfectly reasonable but it is not ground for me or anyone to become christian more to the point it doe not add weight to the claim that jesus wa the real thing niether wa he lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who wa crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously fool logical people see this right away have you ever seen documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point did tony mention this one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleague fool or illogical men their support of hitler wa based presume upon an emotional issue rather than rational agreement with his principle obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler wa sane therefore since he wasn a liar or lunatic he must have been the real thing hmmm don think his argument warrant the use of therefore some other thing to note he fulfilled load of prophecy in the psalm isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hr alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion don have my bible with me at this moment next time write will use it this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussion have had with people result in quoting the bible the only reasonable way think people can look at the bible is to treat the story a some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author were trying to present if someone try to interpret part of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sort of shit tony argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the event described in the bible took place but to convince someone who think the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless for example in mathematics you cannot say is equal to because is equal to i don think most people understand what christian is that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious war and why there are hundred of different version all claiming to be correct it is certainly not what see lot in church rather think it should be way of life and total sacrafice of everything for god sake he loved u enough to die and save u so we should do the same hey we can do it god himself inspires u to turn our life over to him that tuff and most people don want to do it to be real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drum whatever it take time we don rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once week or helping poor people once in while we box everything into time unit such a work at this time sport tv social life god is above these box and should be carried with u into all these box

com kent sandvik writes my online bible is on cd but don own cd rom system for the time being so can search for the famous cite where jesus explicitly state that he didn want to break existing jewish law in other word technically speaking christian should use saturday and not sunday a their holy day if they want to conform to the teaching of jesus think the passage you re looking for is the following matthew 5 17 think not that have come to abolish the law and the prophet have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew 5 18 for truly say to you till heaven and earth pas away not an iota not dot will pas from the law until all is accomplished matthew 5 19 whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandment and teach men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who doe them and teach them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven matthew 5 20 for tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribe and pharisee you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there are several problem with this the most serious is that the law wa regarded by jew at the time and now a binding on jew but not on gentile there are rule that were binding on all human being the so called noachic law but they are quite minimal the issue that the church had to face after jesus death wa what to do about gentile who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn say that the law wa abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn apply to gentile this is simple answer which think just about everyone can agree to discussion of the issue in more or le these term is recorded in act 15 however there more involved in order to get full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least a read paul he say that the law serf purpose that ha been in certain sense superceded again this issue isn one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul note that he might be understood this way and assures u that that not what he intends to say rather he see the law a primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it an impossible standard and one that ha been superceded by christ paul comment are not the world clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position doe not entail an abolition of the law it still remains a an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for it purpose of convicting of sin it important that it not be relaxed however for christian it not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical category they use are rather different in the end think jesus and paul come to rather similar conclusion the quoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus show u how he interprets the law the not an iota or dot would suggest rather literal reading but in fact that not jesus approach jesus interpretation emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial detail indeed he is well known for taking rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat 5 17 20 need to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewish discussion jesus accuses his opponent of caring about giving tenth of even the most minor herb but neglecting the thing that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cup and plate are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat 23 23 25 this and the discussion later in mat 5 suggest that jesus ha very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintaining the law in it full strength he is thinking of these aspect of it paul conclusion is similar while he talk about the law being superceded all of the specific example he give involve the ceremonial law such a circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standard the net result of this is that when paul talk about the law being superceded and jesus talk about the law being maintained believe they are talking about different aspect of the law paul is embroiled in argument about circumcision a is natural in letter responding to specific situation he looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law a specifically jewish ceremony he certainly doe not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in it broadest implication for moral and human relationship and deemphasizing those aspect that were later to give paul so much trouble it unfortunate that people use the same term in different way but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the way term like family value take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why family value should be used a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the s think law had taken on similar role in the argument paul wa involved in paul wa clearly not rejecting all of the jewish value that go along with the term law any more than people who concerned about the family value movement are really opposed to family value',\n",

program like freedom or shuttle is performed at nasa center the center skim off portion which go into what amount to slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager want to fund this sum is estimated to be over third of the fund allocated think about that of the 30 billion cost of freedom fully 10 billion won be spent on anything having anything to do with space station now maybe that 10 billion wa wisely spent and maybe it wasn but the work done with it should stand on it own merit not distorting the cost of other project congress ha no idea of the existense of these wrap congress ha never heard the term center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that third of the money is going for something else my dear friend your mixing fact and fiction here couple of week ago when first read this in your posting talked with one of the cost expert here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why didn post response immediately do have real job m supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old 20 khz data looking into sherzer kyger claim rate pretty low on the totem pole of priority also spent last weekend in kansa city at the national science teacher association conference extolling the virtue of ssf to 15 000 science teacher first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap doe exist if recall the number correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around 40 million this wa computed by adding up the wp 1 wp 2 and wp 4 center tax with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at 2 2 billion my calculater say the tax percentage is 04 2 2 1 8 over the life of the ssf program using your figure of 30 billion for the cost of ssf tax at 1 8 rate come to 540 million this is alot le than 10 billion but will concede it still an appreciable amount of pocket change should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1 3 could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on fund that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some state where you do have to pay sale tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you don if you get it take out for example at wp 4 the vast bulk of the fund we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax don have the number in front of me but d guess at least 95 of the wp 4 fund go to rocketdyne so you could be right about tax rate of 1 3 but it only applied to fund spent at the center and not to the prime contract this lead to the obvious question what is the government doing with ssf fund that don go to the prime contractor e ok wp 4 get slice of the 30 billion pie big portion of this slice go to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the fund which aren eaten up by the center tax at wp 4 we call these fund we spend in house supporting development fund a they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these fund to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed ha real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research few year back with lead acid car battery to simulate the nickel hydrogen battery on ssf dc switchgear dc dc converter unit and simulated load data from the testbed wa used in recent change evaluation involving concern about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen battery which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana a side point 6 of the battery cell on test recently hit the four year life test milestone 38 cell have completed 18 552 to 23 405 cycle the on orbit battery go through 5 840 cycle per year a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development fund to purchase personal computer and work station for performing system analysis like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculation using monte carlo simulation setting up database with information on weight of the power system element finally the money raised by the tax doe not all go into slush fund at lewis the director doe control small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however go to fund the general service at the center like the library the central computer service division the contractor who remove the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn go for ssf activity to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library fund used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for 1 year is billable to ssf would you base it on the person hour ssf employee spend reading av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that go to support the library who know maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about burecratic nightmare my last point is that can believe your claim that congress ha never heard of the term center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congress isn on computer so can do simple word search someplace

deletion will argue that your latter statement believe that no god exist doe rest upon faith that is if you are making positive statement that no god exist strong atheism rather than merely saying don know and therefore don believe in them and don not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying believe that god doe not exist still maintain the position even after reading the faq that strong atheism requires faith no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here that driving car requires faith that the car drive m not saying this at all it requires no faith on my part to say the car drive because ve seen it drive ve done more than at in fact ve actually driven it now what doe require some faith is the belief that my sens give an accurate representation of what out there but there is no evidence pro or con for the existence or non existence of god see what have to say below on this for me it is conclusion and have no more faith in it than have in the premise and the argument used sorry if remain skeptical don believe it entirely conclusion that you have seen no evidence that there is god is correct neither have but lack of evidence for the existence of something is in no way evidence for the non existence of something the creationist have similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never seen neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy break down and is rather naive have scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life evolution when draw the conclusion that pink unicorn don exist because haven seen them this conclusion ha it foundation in observation and theory pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entity that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth ha evolved from more primitive ancestor these pink unicorn would share common anscestory with horse and zebra and such god however ha no such correspondence with anything imo there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusion from but first let me say the following we might have language problem here in regard to faith and existence a christian maintain that god doe not exist to exist mean to have being in space and time god doe not have being god is being kierkegaard once said that god doe not exist he is eternal with this said feel it rather pointless to debate the so called existence of god and that is not what m doing here believe that god is the source and ground of being when you say that god doe not exist also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different thing by it however in what follows will use the phrase the existence of god in it usual sense and this is the sense that think you are using it would like clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god no that a word game disagree with you profoundly on this haven defined god a existence in fact haven defined god but this might be getting off the subject although if you think it relevant we can come back to it further saying god is existence is either waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it fallacy you are using wrong category here or perhaps you misunderstand what m saying m making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy m not trying to convince you of anything believe and that rest upon faith and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tell you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or then the use of logic to disprove their claim if fine and necessary btw an incomplete argument is not fallacy some thing are not even wrong deletion one can never prove that god doe or doe not exist when you say that you believe god doe not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation will have to ask what observtions are you refering to there are no observation pro or con that are valid here in establishing positive belief deletion where doe that follow aren observation based on the assumption that something exists don follow you here certainly one can make observation of thing that they didn know existed still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that god doe not exist such positive assertion requires leap and wouldn you say there is level of definition that the assumption god is is meaningful if not would reject that concept anyway so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level once again you seem to completely misunderstand me have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level maybe such response a you gave just come naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat

attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasn a funny a atheism nowhere doe that imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist a most people who post such inflammatory remark are theist it wa reasonable assumption sorry you re right did not clearly state it rule 2 condescending to the population at large e theist will not win many people to your faith anytime soon it only ruin your credibility how am being condescending to the population at large am stating something that happened to be true for long time couldn believe that people actually believed in this god idea it wa an alien concept to me am not trying to win people to my faith a you put it have no faith religion wa non issue when had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to believe atheist by default guess you could say the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude once one ha accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god and then consider other faith to be irrational simply because their assumption contradict your assumption then would say there a lack of consistency here now know you ll get on me about faith if the _positive_ belief that god doe not exist were closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problem with that logic but you probably like me seem to be soft atheist sorry for the flamage the line about atheist haveing something up their sleeve is what seemed to imply that sorry been reading too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some what is the clipper project btw rule 4 don mix apple with orange how can you say that the extermination by the mongol wa worse than stalin khan conquered people unsympathetic to his cause that wa atrocious but stalin killed million of his own people who loved and worshipped _him_ and his atheist state how can anyone be worse than that many ruler have done similar thing in the past only stalin did it when there wa plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him the evidence is that some of the early european ruler ruled with an iron fist much like stalin you threw in number and am sick of hearing about stalin a an example because the example doesn apply you managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all form of atheism it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but it point wa that mass killing happens for all sort of reason people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer sickle the stalin example _is_ important not only because it still widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his idea even after all that he had wrought the evidence am referring to is more lack of evidence than negative evidence say claim there are no pink crow have never seen pink crow but that doesn mean it couldn exist but this person here claim that there are pink crow even though he admits he hasn been able to capture one or get photo or find one with me etc in sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crow that is what am saying when look at the evidence look at the suppossed evidence for deity show how it is flawed and doesn show what theist want it to show and go on first all the pink crow unicorn elf argument in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy why one of the big reason is that many many people want something beyond this life you can pretend that they don want this but for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want god can love a truth be proven logically themselves namely god or god so in principle it hard to see how theist are necessarily arrogant make no sense to me they seem arrogant to make such claim to me but my previous refutation still stand and believe there may be another one on the net john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all many christian know also boast in this way but still do not necessarily see it a arrogance of course do know arrogant christian doctor and teacher a well technically you might consider the person who originally made given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism if you

degree if you have problem with what nick think should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so fred again you really don get what the complaint are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaint something between feeling regarding nick method and judgment about his meaning maybe d get it if you said what the complaint are about rather than doing the same thing that you mean to complain about when you trash people how am supposed to read that a trashing people is bad gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps fred issue 1 nick alleged trashing of others only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically that wa my point all along fred not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your idea on matter of policy and project in space but your response wa just baiting not even part of debate have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling debate see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick see him questioning people ethic again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa m glad you can laugh since your ratio of debate insult is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when m dealing with someone like nick see we are dealing with problem in conflict of interpretation not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that disagree with you on that last point why don you take poll fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and a usual you defend your insult with he started it yeah took some of his research and called it my own but he started it so what if stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that think it still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool never borrowed it already gave it back and it wa broken when you gave it to me make up yer mind fred m not convinced that people are necessary in all part of every space based process and your response doesn tell me thing about the reason why you think they should be except to impune the motif of the person with divergent opinion who said think they should be tommy show me note where said that and ll eat this terminal see below fred fred cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion wa incorrect e that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first try to address what think you meant for which am rewarded with denial of sort and smart remark then point out that am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you second time and m stupid for it just can win can fred you ve got great point here somewhere it just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinion you never actually get around to making it please quote the it took issue with believe you will see if you look that what wa and am taking issue with is mr szabo idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time a his toaster based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue 2 nick alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick or you would have really good point instead you have provided good reason to ignore your insult since they are based on incorrect interpretation that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insult more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people aren required in all part of all space process so your taking issue with his opinion regarding people in the space program read a people are required in all part of all space process so help me out here fred since m so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter sure hope it one of those cheeto and string model that all the computer mag have been raving about the point is _i_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption d only be stupid if insulted you for having made it but ala that your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two point simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behavior that you do a much a anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no finally got it you don like the plan that nick post made you imagine and you don like nick obnoxious behavior even though it no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone a dense a myself if you have problem with nick delivery address that the way you bait you re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the bait is that which elicits the response nick bait just flame him for being an obnoxious fool don really care who started it read this list to get information and other view on the issue to which it wa dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time that nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money worth perhaps if you weren deliberately too thick to get the point the first time wouldn have to waste time explaining myself all the time of course socrates how could it be otherwise think it neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonition to me about how such thing should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of net ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought wa new and hence could be instructed tommy saw you come on the net who care who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after brief haitus before which wa on for about 2 year if you had seen me on the net first you remember when nick and went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that no worse than your own let see here my complaint about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flame against people you decide are flamers isn and my complaint about your name calling are immature while your name calling isn yeah right maybe if you called me some more name might see it better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred you ve correctly interpreted my motivation when yours are impossible to judge from your action a your insulting of people that try prof didn really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what really wanted wa to impress everyone only put my complaint with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there

therefore all those christian who worship jesus and pray to jesus and expect jesus to return and save them from their sin are only kidding themselves and have allowed themselves to be duped by religion that wa mostly manufactured by the roman and emotional feeling are totally deceiving indicator for religious validity these thing are similarly true for follower of most other major world religion including islam thirdly the primary function of each master is to tune his initiate into the audible life stream or sound current referred to a the word in john 1 1 5 and a the river of life in revelation 22 1 and to personally guide each of them thru the upper level of heaven while they are still connected to their living physical body by silver cord true salvation which completes soul cycle of reincarnation in the physical and psychic plane is achieved only by reaching at least the soul plane which is five level or universe above the physical universe and this cannot be done without the help of physically living divine master one such divine master alive today is an american sri harold klemp the living eck master or mahanta for the eckankar organization now headquartered in minneapolis o box 27300 zip 55427 another divine master is maharaj gurinder singh ji now living in punjab india and is associated with the sant mat organization one of the classic book on this subject is the path of the master radha soami book o box 242 gardena ca 90247 written in 1939 by dr julian johnson theologian and surgeon who spent the last year of his life in india studying under and closely observing the sant mat master of that time maharaj sawan singh ji several of the eckankar book including some authored by sri paul twitchell or sri harold klemp can be found in most public and university library and some book store or obtained thru inter library loan the book eckankar the key to secret world by sri paul twitchell is another classic many christian are likely to confuse the master with the anti christ which is or wa to be temporary world dictator during the so called last day but the master don ever rule even when asked or expected to do so a jesus wa people who continue following christianity islam or other orthodox religion with physically dead master will continue on their cycle of reincarnation between the psychic plane and this miserable physical world until they finally accept initiation from physically living divine master re incarnation the book here and hereafter by ruth montgomery describes several kind of evidence supporting reincarnation a fact of life including hypnotic regression to past life about 50 accurate the subconscious mind sometimes make thing up especially with bad hypnotist spontaneous recall especially by young child some of whom can identify their most recent previous relative home possession etc dream recall of past life experi ences deja vu familiarity with far off land while travel ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read ings of the late edgar cayce and even supporting statement from the christian bible including matthew 17 11 13 john the baptist wa the reincarnation of elia and john 9 1 2 how can person possibly sin before he is born unless he lived before always use the king james version later version are per version strong interest innate talent strong phobia etc typically originate from person past life for example strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually result from having drowned at the end of previous life and sometimes person will take an immediate dislike to another person being met for the first time in this life because of bad encounter with him during previous incarnation the teaching of reincarnation also includes the law of karma galatian 6 7 revelation 13 10 etc people would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their action in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future or in future incarnation 2nd coming if divine master physically dy translates before particular initiate of his doe then when that initiate physically dy translates the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul plane this is the one and only correct meaning of 2nd coming it is an individual experience not something that happens for everyone all at once people who are still waiting for jesus 2nd coming are waiting in vain plane of existence the physical universe is the lowest of at least dozen major level of existence above the physical plane is the astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric plane often counted a the upper part of the mental plane the soul plane and several higher spiritual plane the soul plane is the first true heaven counting upward from the physical the plane between but not including the physical and soul plane are called the psychic plane it is likely that esp telepathy astrological influence radionic effect biological transmutation see the 1972 book with that title and other phenomenon without an apparent physical origin result from interaction between the psychic plane and the physical plane the major plane are also sub divided for example sub plane of the astral plane is called hades and the christian hell occupies small part of it created there le than 2000 year ago by the early catholic church by some kind of black magic or by simply teaching it existence in threatening manner the christian heaven is located elsewhere on the astral plane good christian will go there for short while and then reincarnate back to earth sound current v blind faith the christian religion demand of it follower an extraordinary amount of blind faith backed up by little more than good feeling which is totally deceiving if person is not hearing some form of the sound current the word the ban the audible life stream then his cycle of reincarnation in this miserable world will continue the sound current manifest differently for different initiate and can sound like rushing wind ocean wave on the sea shore buzzing bee higher pitched buzzing sound flute various heavenly music or other sound in eckankar member start hearing it near the end of their first year a member this and other experience such a soul travel replace blind faith for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source 3 book 2 address un altered

stanford edu voelkerding writes in article 1993apr12 143834 26803 seachg com chrisb seachg com chris blask writes add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell block year of court cost extra guard and the benefit of the death penalty entirely disappear that because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death override the benefit of all the others obviously it tragic but it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty if we went to war and worried about accidentally killing civilian all of the time because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then there is no way to win the war yes fortunately we have right thinking folk like your good self in power and it wa therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred of thousand of iraqi in order to liberate oil h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news medium the fact are that le iraqi died in the gulf war than did civilian in any other war of comparable size this century this wa due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing technique which were technically possible only recently the idea that hundred of thousand of iraqi citizen died is ludicrous not even hundred of thousand of iraqi soldier died and they were the one being targeted or do you think that the u and it ally were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilian either the smart bomb didn hit their target and we know they did or they were targeting civilian target which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq military potential the military mission planner are not fool they know they have to hit military target to win war hitting civilian target doe nothing but unite the people against you not laudable goal if one want the people to rise up against their tyrant dictator ok so some innocent people died yes maybe the unarmed civilian fleeing along that road didn need to be bombed to bit perhaps that kid with half his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled leg weren entirely guilty but it worth the death of few innocent to save the oil h hlives of the kuwaiti people isn it after all the iraqi may not have had chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of his regime by not assassinating him right all that surrendering and fleeing along open road wa just devious ploy we were entirely within our right to bomb em just in case without finding out if they were soldier how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww2 don hear you bemoaning them war is never an exact science but with smart bomb it becoming more exact with smaller percentage of civilian casualty sometimes mistake are made target are misidentified innocent die that war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like it one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse like patrick henry said some 217 year ago know not what course others may take but a for me give me liberty or give me death war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wish to stay free the death penalty wa conceived a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigan that have been added automatic appeal lengthy court battle etc have relegated that purpose to very small part of what it should be hence the question is do we instate the death penalty a it wa meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely yes let reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be all that shit about fair trial and court of appeal just get in the way of justice let give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourselves the expense of all those lawyer think of the knock on benefit too la would never have had to spend so much money cleaning up after riot and holding showcase trial if the cop had been allowed to do their job properly quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been saved great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense after all if the police decide man guilty that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalty ha been shown not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well that entirely irrelevant mathew mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like complete peace nik idiot although feel sure that wa not your intent so the iraqi war wa wrong eh m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww2 eh guess we shouldn have fought ww2 either just think of all those innocent german civilian killed in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent we should have just let hitler take over europe and you be speaking german instead of english right now tyrant like hussein have to be stopped his kind don understand diplomacy they only understand the point of gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people sacrifice not to mention the 357 american who died wa for naught liberating kuwait wa good thing but wiping hussein off the map would ve been better and a for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back verdict of not guilty those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and have not seen when one make judgment without the benefit of trial where evidence can be presented on both side one ha simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice state of mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policeman law in this country is intended to protect the right of the accused whether they be criminal or cop one is not found guilty if there is reasonable doubt of one guilt and only the jury is in position to ass the evidence and render verdict anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism regard jim',\n",

long knife in which roehm and most of the sa wing of the nsdap were purged stop hold it you have few problem here official history say that the first accusation of homosexuality in the sa came from outside of the nazi party long before the nazi ever came to power so this objection is red herring even if established history is wrong on this point moreover none of the history ve read ever made mention of hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality a pretext for purging roehm point saw reiterated wa that hitler and the party covered up these accusation if you are going to accuse official history of being fabrication you should at least get your fact right the pretext for purging roehm wa that he wa planning to use the sa in coup against hitler nowhere is there mention of using allegation of homosexuality a pretext for the purge nor a justification afterwards it is possible that the history ve read have not mentioned this but doubt it would it be in hitler best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man wa homosexual anyway a said before it is always possible that have missed reference to the nazi making use of charge of homosexuality against the sa after the night of the long knife but this doe not prove that they were false even the nazi could tell the truth when it wa to their advantage in any case this doe not deal with accusation of homosexuality in the sa during the 1920 since the accuser thereafter controlled the record anything bearing on the subject true or not ha to be considered tainted evidence ah yes forgot this wa being posted to alt conspiracy can smell the paranoia from here since the nazi never officially charged roehm with homosexuality at least not according to what ve read d like to know what tainted evidence you are talking about since the accusation were made by person outside of the nazi party long before it came to power and those accusation were common knowledge to journalist and others in germany in the 1920 and 30 just how would it be possible for the nazi to go back in time and plant tainted evidence how exactly doe one doctor newspaper which were circulated around the world without the discrepancy being obvious what actual incidence of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about and what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matter some of whom were not nazi and what is the point of making false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point here seems to be to discredit established history then the burden of proof fall on the revisionist the revisionist had better do their homework before making accusation otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nut the available data suggest that roehm and his crowd the sa sturmabteilung storm trooper left the world better place when they departed this is just about the only thing we agree on suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people roehm and his sa buddy who were homosexual must disturb some people the feeling seems to be that if nasty individual is accused of homosexuality that this must be an attempt to bash homosexual this fear often justified is what lie behind this distrust of official history or so it seems to me but this is not good justification for trashing accepted account of this subject if you really think that historian are so incompetent why don you write them and ask where they got their source on this subject if you can tell from their footnote m graduate student in history writing to professor and tracking down source is old hat but my time is limited and this is not my specialty and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence m not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone paranoia do the research yourself but concrete particular are still no more than more or le shrewd guess diccon frankborn given that you already consider all evidence

machinelet ha small tv camera utilizing ccd tv chip mounted on it personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression to allow for minimal image to be sent to the operator for control purpose and also return control signal the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model train with tv camera built in are almost off the shelf item and control electronics for starting and stopping train are minimal the user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 second depending on the speed of their data link to ltm1 next an ssto scale model with ccd tv chip will be suspended from servo motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape

which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developer by taking graphically oriented communication program dmodem and adding tele operation screen and control the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hour plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network ha agreed to sponsor this project by providing host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar ha in stock the electronic tank that can be modified and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communication package and modify it for control of the machine let an initial ground breaking with miniature shovel will be performed for live photo session and news conference on april 30 1993 the initial model will be put in place time lapse record will be started for historical purpose it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operation and experiment photographer will be present and the photograph taken will be converted to gif image for distribution world wide to major online network and bb a press release will be issued calling for contribution of idea time talent material and scale model for the simulated lunar colony contest for new design and technique for working on the moon will then be announced university will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructor who wish to have class participation in various aspect of the lunar colony model field trip to ltm1 can be arranged and at that time the result of the class work will be added to the model contributor will then be able to tele operate any contributed machine let once they return to their campus monthly ltm1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional mean to the medium any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news medium having large real model space colony will be very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world science fiction writer will be invited to issue challenge to engineering and human factor student at university to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar task using counter weight and pulley system 1 6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenge the long term goal is creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of lunar colony ltm1 ha the potential of being long term global edutainment method for space activity and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject area not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to generation of people who are ready for the leap to the star conclusion edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment anyone who ha ever enjoyed seeing miniature will probably see the potential impact of globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purpose by creating tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also method of trying new idea that require real not virtual skill and open new method for putting people mind in space moonlighter illuminating the path of

it is not generally true see every single line item on contract and have to sign it there is no such thing a wrap at this university dennis have worked on or written proposal worth ten of million of customer included government including nasa for profit and non profit company all expected wrap usually called fee much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractor the subcontractor where university for profit non profit and even some of the nasa center for the commercialization of space all charged fee a part of the work down the street is one of the nasa commercialization center they charge fee you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen in that post you stated that the wrap wa on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true now m sure your competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience in several area your post show that you don understand the importance of integration in large project you also show lack of understanding of costing effort a shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental cost for everything this isn a flame jsut statement come your little ol bun down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it your employer doe charge fee you may not see it but you do of course there is fee it is for administration geez allen any organization ha cost but there is heck of difference in legitimate cost such a library and other thing that must be there to support program and wrap a you originally stated it you stated that wrap wa on top of all of the overhead which couple of sentence down you say is not true which is it allen sound like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your costing people how much fee they add to project did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead well there you are dennis a said they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer a you have posted on this subject allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is seperate charge you admit here that this is wrong nasa ha line item budget every year have seen it allen get some number from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap number and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind no allen you did not you merely repeated allegation made by an employee of the overhead capital of nasa integration dennis isn overhead nothing that reston doe could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa center where the work is going on integration could be done better at the center apollo integration wa done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston is totally wrong allen there you have bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it ha never worked in any large scale project that it wa ever tried on could you imagine reston like set up for apollo dennis reston ha been the only nasa agency working to reduce cost when wp 02 wa hemoraging out billion the center you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston wa the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problem and building station oh you are full of it allen on this one agree that jsc screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced to make stupid statement like that just show how deep your bias go come to msfc for couple of week and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the fact are contrary to it kinda funny isn it that someone who talk about problem like this is at place where everything is overhead when you have bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration isn overhead it is the single most important part of successful large scale effort agree that integration is the single most important part of successful large scale effort what completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work it is called leadership allen that is what made apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo wa held by le than 50 people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up a reston is you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do much better job why did it take year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is one heck of lot do not know allen but one thing do know is that for project to be successful you must have leadership remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shamble for year do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the program problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa is only symptom of greater national problem you are so narrowly focused in your effort that you do not see this why did the space news artice point out that it wa the congressionally demanded change that caused the problem methinks that you are being selective with the fact again the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the center you support so much who covered up the overhead and wouldn address the problem until the press published the story are you saying the reston manager where wrong to get nasa to address the overrun you approve of what the center did to cover up the overrun no am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have happened in the first place if it take four flight year to resupply the station and you have cost of 500 million flight then you pay 2 billion year you stated that your friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for billion year if the wrap were gone this merely point out blatent contridiction in your number that

in half plus transport sorry gang but have deadline for satellite so someone else is going to have to do allen math for him for while will have little chance to do so do hope you can find the time to

independent theoretical group and wa organized by dr michael prather nasa goddard institute for space study the three group involved michael prather and maria garcia nasa gi charlie jackman and anne douglas nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort wa to look at the effect of the space shuttle and titan rocket on the stratosphere the following are the estimated source of stratospheric chlorine industrial source 300 000 000 kilogram year natural source 75 000 000 kilogram year shuttle source 725 000 kilogram year the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttle and 6 titan rocket are launched yearly thus the launch would add le than 0 25 to the total stratospheric chlorine source the effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0 0065 this is much le than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flare the influence of human made chlorine product on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculation to be 1 decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 the influence of the space shuttle and titan rocket on the stratosphere is negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rocket would need to be increased by over factor of hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone a our increase in

commission report for example what looked like an explosion wa fuel burning after the external tank came apart the force on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronaut never mind destroy their body according to the kerwin team medical forensic report the astronaut were killed when the more or le intact cabin hit the water at circa 200mph and their body then spent several week underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can use the shuttle orbiter for mission beyond low earth orbit because it can get there it is big and heavy and doe not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tank furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is thing like wing which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth surface and low orbit taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystem to build specialized high orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by henry

sgi com my comment regarding dec wa to indicate that might be open to other vendor that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is graphic programming library and a such is great portable interface for the development of interactive 3d graphic application it is not however an indicator of performance a that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphic system and software tool so opengl mean that you can port easily from sgi to other platform there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable what am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of fork lift truck if your sale representative truly mislead you then you should have valid grievance against u which you should carry up to your local sgi sale management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sale come from satisfied customer so give it shot m also annoyed about being sold several personal iris at previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around

individual cpu subsystem running at particular clock rate usually live for about 2 year new graphic architecture at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every 18 month to 2 year these are the fact of life if we look at these machine they become almost archaic after four year and we have to come out with new platform like indigo onyx challenge which ha higher bus bandwidth faster cpu faster graphic and o and larger disk capacity if we don we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy machine that meet your current need and make economic sense today you can wait to buy but if you need guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sale rep for one in writing if it feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade path have specific program

regular basis most sgi customer are onesy twosey type but regardless we rarely give great deal of notice when we are about to introduce new system because again like previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customer schedule when they were counting on the availability of the new system on particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investor and the financial analyst who watch u most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitment the box that we buy now will have to last u pretty much through the entire grant period of five year and in some case beyond that mean that need to buy the best piece of equipment that can when have the money not some product that wa built to paraphrase one previous poster word to fill niche to compete with some other vendor m going to be looking at this box for the next five year and every time look at it m going to think about sgi and how could have better spent my money actually your money since we re supported almost entirely by federal tax dollar five year is an awfully long time in computer year new processor technology are arriving every 1 2 year making 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generation behind the time the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really 5 year between purchase you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some reality about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customer happy is the most

here is his posting in article 8feu_ko00xsf0kpc5p andrew cmu edu david hunt bluelobster cmu edu writes m pretty sure ve seen biblical rule for when it allowable to rape prisoner what the code are about that etc could some more knowledgable soul than please let me know some reference he asked very narrow question and gave very narrow answer yes sorry have got that wrong my apology deletion no david hunt post didn mention god nor did my response you were the first to bring up the idea of the bible being given by god most jew don believe this in any literal sense so no fun but must have met the minority then and given by god refers to any action whereby god god cause or better effect something rob am not intimate with jewish theology but understand that you are messianic jew correct me if am wrong but it appears that the view of messianic jew on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jew while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god view have heard that it is possible for jew to attribute evil to their god an no no for christian the bible is still seen a effect of the interaction of some god with man deletion no thought we agreed that though jew disagree there are set of core belief that they do agree upon one of which is that the commandment are accessible and written in the language of the time and another of which is that there must be legal system to update them the context wa metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandment is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion wonder how you break out of the shackle of having metaphysics in your system deletion could you explain this with respect to the original commandment being discussed that is the commandment that say if you feel like raping woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her what about the way this commandment is given invalidates it is is in book that command to commit genocide among other reprehensible deed the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passage a an example for the content of the whole book big deletion the point is that see that there is necessary connection between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible only very loosely my interpretation of the bible is based on long tradition of jewish scholar interpreting the bible theology doesn really enter into it there are jewish atheist who interpret the law of charity essentially the same way do no not the interpretation of some law but the interpretation of the bible a in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with god whatever that mean that alone is theo logic question is proof of theology used you pose another metaphysical riddle no you do well you wrote this fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power nor absolute knowledge and a it appears limited mean or will to communicate with u some form of spiritual big friend do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual am right in the assumption that it cannot have created the universe a well and that the passage in the bible referring to that or it omnipotence are crap that what meant by the riddle it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha mean either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is ha one to carry the burden of biblical text when one could simply write other book that convey the message better you might answer that one can becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that hold true of every other book and the question remains why ha the bible still special place can it be replaced somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included a well deletion do you see the danger in doing so especially with the metaphers used in the bible think the danger of doing so is le than either the danger of having frozen system of law or having no law sorry but there are worse system doe not say anything about if one could not have better system deletion if we read two story about the importance of helping the poor and in one god is spirit and in the other god ha body which is more important helping the poor or resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god if we read two story in the bible one that god command people to kill child for being idolater and another where god kill child directly what is more important to resolve the message that child are to be killed or if it ha to be done by god and the argument you have given is fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other question religious believer resolve contradiction with that they choose one of the possibility given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god one cannot

zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant wa the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2 1 12 the old persian word magu rendered in greek by magos is of uncertain etymology it may originally have meant member of the tribe a in the avestan compound mogu tbish hostile to member of the tribe this meaning would have been further resticted among the medes to member of the priestly tribe and perhaps to priest benveniste 1938 boyce 1982 the term is probably of median origin given that herodotus mention the magoi a one of the six tribe of the medes for variety of reason we can consider the magi to have been member of priestly tribe of median origin in western iran among the persian they were responsible for liturgical function a well a for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult most likely the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran became established during the time of the median monarchy that dominated the persian from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great 550 bce the persian were indebted to the medes for their political and civil institution a well even if hypothesis have been advanced concerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyce 1982 we must still maintain that they were of median origin this is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian mentioned by darius 522 486 bce in the inscription at bisutun iran a well a by greek source indeed herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persian through the conspiracy of the magi the fact that the magi may have been member of tribe that handed down the sacerdotal art in hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions this seems to be attested by the elamite tablet at persepolis there is thesis put forth by giuseppe messina that denies that the magi are member of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply member of the priesthood priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin this thesis is untenable on the other hand the hypothesis that their name is related to the avestan term magavan derived from the gathic maga vedic magha gift is not without foundation mole 1963 the meaning of maga can probably be found in conformity with the pahlavi tradition within the context of the concept of purity or separation of the mixture of the two opposed principle of spirit and matter the maga which ha been erroneously interpreted a chorus from the root mangh which is said to mean sing the magic song nyberg 1966 and ha been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica seems to be an ecstatic condition that open the mind to spiritual vision in any case though there may be relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and maga we must maintain clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood the avesta ignores the median or old persian term despite recent hypothesis proposed by w bailey old persian inscription ignore the avestan term for priest athravan vedic athravan even if this is perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablet of persepolis gershevitch 1964 the term magu ha been present in zoroastrianism throughout it history the pahlavi term mogh mard and mobad represent it continuation the latter in particular derives from an older form magupati head of the magi during the sasanid period third to seventh century ce which saw the formation of hierarchically organized church the title mobadan mobad the high priest of high priest came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the magi practiced consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha av pahl khwedodah they also performed characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animal and vulture to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it the corpse wa not supposed to decompose lest it be contaminated by the demon of putrefaction this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastrian community and led to the rise of complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsi in india stone tower known a dakhmas were built especially for this rite during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse wa in vogue only among the magi the persian generally sprinkled the corpse with wax then buried it the practice wa widespread however among the people of central asia the magi were the technician of and expert on worship it wa impossible to offer sacrifice without the presence of magus during the performance of ritual sacrifice the magus sang of the theogony the magi were possibly the custodian of tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various part of the avesta and wa called upon to interpret dream and to divine the future the magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful or ahrimanical animal khrafstra such a snake and ant they dressed in the median style wearing pant tunic and coat with sleeve they wore characteristic head covering of felt gr tiara with strip on the side that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during ritual to avoid contaminating consecrated object with their breath boyce 1982 the color of these cap in conformity with tradition that is probably of indo european origin according to george dumezil wa that of the priesthood white in all likelihood during the achaemenid period the magi were not in possession of well defined body of doctrine and it is probable that they gradually adopted zoroastrianism they were most likely clergy consisting of professional priest who were not tied to rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheless they must have been jealous guardian of the patrimony of zorastrian tradition by virtue of this they were the educator of the royal prince the wisest of them wa responsible for teaching the prince the magic of zarathushtra son of horomazes and thus the cult of the god magi who excelled in other virtue were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous and master of himself during the achaemenid period the magi maintained position of great influence although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor despite several dramatic event such a the massacre they suffered after the death of gaumata the magian in which according to herodotus who call himself smerdis the persian killed large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in medium in persia and in the various region of the empire where they were stationed a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration no priesthood of antiquity wa more famous than that of the magi they were renowned a follower of zarathushtra zoroaster a the teacher of some of the greatest greek thinker pythagoras democritus plato a the wise men who arrived guided by star at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem and a the propagator of cult of the sun in india but they were also known a the chaldean the priesthood of babylon known for it occultism this wa perhaps the reason that the term magos had pejorative sense in greek like go expert in the magic art bidez and cumont 1938 indeed the chaldean were expert in all type of magical art especially astrology and had reputation for wisdom a well a knowledge to understand the reason for such various and sometimes discordant view it is necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so called western magi who were later hellenized in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor syria mesopotamia and armenia who came in contact with diverse religious tradition must have sooner or later and in varying degree been influenced by syncretic concept the greek were familiar with both kind of magi and depending on their varying concern would emphasize one or the other aspect of them classical historian and geographer including herodotus and strabo document their custom while the philosopher dwell above all on their doctrine dualism belief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology and eschatology those source most interested in the doctrine of the magi even speak of zarathushtra a magus in doing so they are repeating what the magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid period when they adopted zoroastrianism at that time they embraced zarathushtra a one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformation in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and wa already adapting those element of the archaic religion that refused to die it ha been said quite often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition that the vendidad from vi daevo data the law abjuring daivas part of the avesta should be attributed to them this collection of text from various period is primarily concerned with purificatory rule and practice nonetheless the hypothesis is hardly plausible since the first chapter of the vendidad list of sixteen land created by ahura mazda the supreme god of zoroastrianism but contaminated by an attack by ahriman pahl gathic avestan angra mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering doe not mention western iran persia or medium the land of ragha mentioned in the text cannot be median raghiana furthermore it ha been noted gershevitch 1964 that if the author had been magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institution including their own priesthood would be very strange the magi were above all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have been transmitted to u from the second half of the first millennium bce on this ha been their principal merit we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assumed known to u especially from greek source and in part from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth century ce according to this formulation the two pole of the dualism are no longer a in the gathas spenta mainyu beneficent spirit and angra mainyu hostile spirit but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch 1964 see ahura mazda and angra mainyu this trans formation wa of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro astrianism and wa most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious world in this new dualism which wa that later known to the greek aristotle eudemus of rhodes theopompus and others we can see the affirmation of new current of thought within zoroastrianism to which we give the name zurvanism see zurvanism thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtra treachings a well a in the definition of the new form that these would assume historically their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of zoroastrian idea in the community of the iranian diaspora the greek began to study their doctrine and to take an interest in them xanthus of lydia hermodorus aristotle theopompus hermippus dinon even writing treatise on the persian religion of which only the title and few fragment have survived in the hellenistic period the magi were seen a secular school of wisdom and writing on magic astrology and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious name a zarathushtra ostanes and hystaspes forming an abundant apocryphal literature bidez and cumont 1938 later still eschatology and apocalyptics were fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo christian religion a can be seen in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_ work whose iranian root are undeniable and which most likely date from the beginning of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant wa the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2 1 12 see saoshyant the sasanid period saw the magi once again play determining role in the religious history of iran concerned to win back the western magi de menasce 1956 and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism a the national religion of iran the priest of iranian sanctuary in medium and persia were able to establish true state church strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of canon of scripture the leading figure in the development of state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxy were tosar and kerder the persecutor of mani in the third century saoshyant the avestan term saoshyant future benefactor mpers soshans designates the savior of the world who will arrive at future time to redeem humankind the concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notion of zoro astrianism together with that of dualism it appears a early a in the gathas zarathushtra zoroaster a the prophet of the religion is himself sao shyant one who performs his work for the frashokereti the end of the present state of the world when existence will be rehabilitated and made splendid see frashokereti later zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into true eschatological myth and expanded the number of saoshyants from one to three all the savior are born from the seed of zarathushtra which is preserved through the age in lake kansaoya identified with present day lake helmand in seistan iran protected by 99 999 fravashis or guardian spirit the greatest of the awaited saoshyants the victorious astvatereta he who embodies truth the son of the vispataurvairi she who conquers all is the third who will make existence splendid he appears in yashts 19 upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age death or corruption and will be granted unlimited power at that time the dead will be resurrected and the living will be immortal and indestructable brandishing the weapon with which he kill the powerful enemy of the world of truth that is the world of the spirit and of asha astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable he and his comrade will engage in great battle with the force of evil which will be destroyed the name astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation kellens 1974 a are those of his two brother ukhshyatereta he who make truth grow and ukhshyatnemah he who make reverence grow the name of the three virgin yashts 13 who are impregnated with the seed of zarathushtra when they bathe in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants are equally speculative each of these saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of millennium initiating new age and new cycle of existence astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind the doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the archaemenid period sixth to fourth century bce it wa not perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea but it wa certainly determining factor one that enjoyed great success in the hellenistic period beyond the confines of the iranian world similar concept that of the future buddha maitreya wa most likely indebted to it and christian messianism can trace it root to the same source',\n",

edu dzkriz ocf berkeley edu dennis kriz writes hi all m going to try to do something here that perhaps many would not have thought even possible want to begin the process of initiating literary critical study of the pornography posted on alt sex story to identify the major theme and motif present in the story posted there opening up then the possibility of an objective moral evaluation of the material present there first off let me congratulate you for not posting flame about you sick pervert you are immoral you are all going to hell which seems to be the usual religious post found on the alt sex hierarchy hopefully you won get flamed either you will however be argued with personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground first do not believe that there is any way to find an objective morality morality and value are inherently subjective they represent the belief of person or group of people they can be widely held perhaps even overwhelmingly held but they are never and _can_ never be objective assumption 1 christian bedrock assumption that all that is true come truly from god 2 regarding alt sex story while perhaps even from an objective standpoint the majority of it material is indeed repugnant you come to this conclusion quite quickly when you start thinking about analyzing it material like this some of it reflects some fairly profound need in people a well a some truth and deserve to be pointed out second do not accept the assumption that you make here if a you say you are trying to be objective then why accept morality to begin with by using the christian bible you re defeating your own purpose by doing so in the long run the advantage of making such literary moral analysis is that it will save band width between christian and non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of the stuff on these pornographic group third call me pessimist but you won stop the flamage there will always be people who pop upin alt sex to tell u how sick and twisted and evil we all are just out of curiosity do alt sex reader show up unprovoked in the religion group to tell you all that you are narrow minded censoring overbearing totalitarianists basically there should not be dissonance between christian morality and non christian one either there is value in particular work or there is not whether one is christian or not hm let me provide an example four people get together over dinner to discus morality you me rather conservative moslem and sociopath start off by saying that think it immoral to force people to have sex with you you agree but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender just note really don know your view on homosexuality am just using this a common view of morality for the purpose of this example the moslem say that it is immoral for woman to have their face uncovered the sociopath who ha become bored kill all three of u and eats u but feel no guilt because he ha done nothing wrong morally in his own mind in support for the first assumption the christian scripture say this evidence deleted m not going to accept your evidence for this you ask u to accept the word of god that everything good come from god this is only valid argument for person who share your belief still must say that cataloging the major theme and motif in erotica could be interesting for other reason than yours so good luck with this next part now then what are some of the major theme motif in the pornographic literature on place like alt sex story these are some that ve been able to identify please add comment on them motif 1 the male cinderella in so many of the story there is expressed feeling of alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object the other person of his her desire often story involves protagonist who on the surface is quite average but underneath usually ha an enormous dick who desire to in some way to gain access in definitely sexual way to the other person who he she confesses is far more desireable than he she is and who indeed seems to walk between the rain drop hmmm do detect just wee bit of condescence here motif 2 celebration of indeed preoccupation with beauty not very objective the vast majority of pornographic literature deal with beauty be it innocence somehow about to be lost grace or simply physical beauty and generally most people christian or non will say that beauty is good one could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better or more good than non beautiful people would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true motif 3 one dick is one instrument of redemption might suggest the word penis it seems more in line with the tone of your post blessed are those who are well hung for they shall get laid from what would thus be revised matthew 5 bravo respect you and your sense of humor sir motif 4 sex a an expression of sincere giving there is often enough clear desire on the part of the protagonist to give definitely sexual pleasure to the object person of his her desire yes and this theme is usually what the better story are about however they are not always selfish could point to example in the work of elf sternberg for example motif 5 alt sex story describes sex which is completely removed from the realm of transmitting life so removed is sex from it procreative dimension on alt sex story that one begin to wonder why sex even involves ejaculation a in the context described in pornography it serf then no real purpose it serf the same purpose a it doe in pornographic movie it affirms the virility of the male involved a well a assuring the reader that he the character ha orgasmed the whole picture tm is probably very well described by the catholic teaching on this of the husband and wife in an act of total mutual self giving in the sexual union cooperating with god in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life cf humane vitae your whole picture tm unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church in addition if sex is for procreation then 1 why did god make it pleasurable so that people would want to do it rather than building it in a instinct 2 why did god make it fallible not every sexual encounter result in pregnancy even among catholic doe this mean that they have sinned in any case alt sex story and the catholic teaching will probably not see eye to eye on this for long time granted motif 6 sex used a an instrument violence power and humiliation why pornography seems to tend in that direction really do not know probably volume could be written on the relationship between sex and power humiliation but this probably give good reason why traditionally judeo christianity ha been so negative with regard to sexuality it seems to tend to great moral morass pornography would not tend in those direction if there were not demand for it many

did say that say that would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whim of deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pit because of who am then so be it do you enjoy darkness most people will honestly admit yes most people are fond of their sexual sin their hording of money their selfishness and not to mention their biblical ignorance nope most people are christian most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayer to make the world nice and holy again of doing

robert grant nntp posting host cpuserver acsc com hi everyone thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these group announcing the release of multiverse 1 0 2 multiverse is multi user non immersive window based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment research feature client server based model using berkeley socket no limit to the number of user apart from performance generic client customizable server hierachical object allowing attachment of camera and light source multiple light source ambient point and spot object can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around fast render loop basically it change thing when told to by the server and then render an image from the user viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user action which can then be communicated to other client and therefore to other user the client is designed to be generic in other word you don need to develop new client when you want to enter new world this mean that resource can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptation a will be explained in moment occur in the server this release of the client software support the following functionality hierarchical object with associated addressing multiple light source and type ambient point and spot user interface panel colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rate mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn support the powerglove a an input device this is not because it can but because don have one this will however be one of the first enhancement server this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developer transparent client management client message handling this may not sound like much but it take away the headache of accepting and terminating client and receiving message from them the application writer can work with the assumption that thing are happening locally thing get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your object server selectable extension installation what this mean is that you can decide which object have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want event handler registration when you develop extension for an object you basically write callback function for the event that you want the object to respond to current event supported init move change collide terminate collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision event just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver application because the application developer want to build library of extended object from which to choose the following is all you need to make world server application provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extension will be supported plus any initialization you want to do provide positionobject function this is where you determine where to place new client provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world wld file for new client provide getworldtype function this is where you tell new client what persona they should have provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at minimum you should let the object move by calling move function and let the server sleep for bit to avoid outrunning the client that all there is to it and to prove it here are the line count for the three world server ve provided generic 81 line dactyl 270 line more complicated collision detection due to the stair will probably be improved with future version dogfight 72 line location this software is located at the following site ftp washington edu directory pub virtual world file multiverse 1 0 2 tar future client texture mapping more realistic rendering e buffering or similar gouraud shading hmd support etc etc server physical modelling gravity friction etc enhanced object management interaction etc etc both improved comms hope this provides people with good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it come with practically zero documentation and m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our exploration of the virtual universe ve certainly found fascinating developing it and would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd

into this word he then construct his religious belief around this understanding reading other scripture in the context of these commandment with love benignly understood regard love a no more or le benign than any other christian doe you are merely expressing approval of the consequence find therein which say more about our politics and cultural trapping than about my or any religion love is highly ambiguous word of which christian can write both the gentle word paul us of it in 1 corinthian in passage that even the conservative will quote at you and the word of s eliot in his pentacost hymn love is the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame this is in any case rather to the side of what wa attempting to raise in my note a will become more evident below a non believer find michael christianity kinder and gentler blechhh think you are misreading me rather seriously though given my principle that one cannot force one own notion of sin on another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism russel turpin and others believer and unbeliever alike are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of christian love if take him at his word he cannot condemn the inquisitor because they were also following these commandment a they understood them if you misread can do and have repeatedly done complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in a thorough form a anyone might want demonstration of the harm it ha done to human being in the first place and to respect for let alone love of god in near succession please go back to my quoted word above the possibility that always exists is that or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessor over the last several century could persuade christian of my case that the inquisition doe indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love must also note that the majority of christian have been so persuaded by christian argumentation a well a by secular both christian and non christian prohibition what mr turpin alludes to is trickier point i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the inquisition the inquisitor responds that mother church must however painful this seems discipline her child for their own good in this case the salvation of their soul or if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example deterring others from the same loss of soul i point out that this justification of failure in love depends on highly speculative construal of text and of philosophical assertion that are quite undemonstrable burn me at the stake my rhetoric ha failed but the point am making is sustained what is going on here ha lot to do with cultural baggage in this case the baggage includes nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those place where it ha been eliminated or at least greatly reduced ha very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between and mr turpin is pointing out that if am versus the grand inquisitor b then my persuasion is not very likely to work know this and in what ever personal agony consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney so one possibility fails in this case a it will fail in may others at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not if it entail mistaken assumption share with the inquisitor and that is potentially an even more troubling case in that many of the victim of inquisition will have accepted that they were in fact sinful in such random case a they may actually have been guilty of charge brought against them the point is that the persuasion break down when the party do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and given the main thrust of the inquisition against heresy it is bound to break down in precisely the worst case the conservative don think that is the right word btw will take refuge in what attribute to above that he is justified in causing harm because he think that work to greater good but this is violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel a if one theory about sin entitled one to cast aside jesus word on dealing with sinner cf matthew 5 39ff am radical christian only in that take the gospel seriously or for that matter what doe it mean to love one fellow man and what is the right thing and how doe one go about loving god well the whole point of making these the base commandment is that they aren reducible to rule set of rule is moral code or law code or an algorithm for acting such thing can be very helpful to individual or society but not if they are used instead of personal involvement in and responsibility for one action the great commandment is more than anything else call to act a if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action demand that like most would rather not hear but it keep popping up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important that be open to trying this than succeeding at it conservative may twist this act a if you were god to mean lay down rule for other people and be a nasty to them a possible if they don keep your rule they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy is how god act that after all is the standard accusation against god by the atheist here and elsewhere that the conservative have confused their manipulative hoop jumping notion of coercing other people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard american atheism and quite agree with it on this point ethical system are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo up front much of which sound pretty much the same but by the specific act procedure and argument that they recommend and different body of christian have from the beginning urged different ethical system or in some case none a result it is bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamous with christianity christianity doe not have torah it doe not have qu ran specifically christian scripture ha very little if anything in the way of commandment so little that the christian who desperately want commandment go mining for them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their effort the one single thing in the gospel which jesus specifically give a commandment to u is love one another will be expanding on this point in reply to paul hudson that hope to get to in day or so it is quite true that some christian infer lot of commandment from the nt ll point out what ha to be going on in these inference and why there is huge amount of cultural baggage involved you are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical system but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our society is eager to hand u one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need principle for the critique of ethical system in which case will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again am glad that few christian such a michael find benign meaning for the goo and then interpret the usually ugly specific in more constructive fashion on the other hand do think that this tell u more about michael and christian like him that it tell u about christianity think you are begging the question why don i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you something about christianity nor is

might be of interest ve transcribed some of my note below since my note taking ability is by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operation of rimsat wa invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deal with arm control disarmament and international security rimsat wa considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launcher and satellite think it also helped that his daughter is grad student in the international relation program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit friend while he wa there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be big tv fan matt bought the king satellite dish which the king thought wa really nifty since tonga ha gnp of about 70 million his majesty asked if there wa any way to make money off this matt thought there probably wa so at his suggestion tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slot while this isn entirely off the wall it wa very unusual seeing a tonga wa tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 is lot of slot the whole thing wa debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently respected space lawyer wrote several opinion supporting tonga case eventually tonga ended up with 7 slot ranging from 70 to 170 slot are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from 130 to 142 are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communication between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat wa formed to use these slot it wa officially formed in nevis a tax haven they tried for few year to raise fund in the west however to fill 7 slot with western satellite launched on western launcher would have cost approximately 2 billion it not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh term that don think ll visit there for long time besides significant lack of creature comfort he wa not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper document and license that indicate they are the only one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellite at cost of 150 million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg say that this is because they were basically bunch of kgb operative who went to trade show and picked up lot of brochure since glavkosmos wa out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authority he again described life in moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term eventually he worked out deal and on dec 4 1992 he met with koptev who head the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on few concession before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rule to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing a rimsat the next step wa to meet with the builder of the hardware npo applied mechanic npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia can figure out how to spell the town need an atlas and ha built about 1500 vehicle since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberian are very different from musovites they are hard worker honest people who team up to get thing done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comment from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberian and midwesterners sternberg had lot of good thing to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partner it apparently cost the russian about 4 million to build satellite that would sell for 50 million in the west if you want to give them specification they ll build you satellite for the particular satellite that rimsat will be using cost run about 378 000 per transponder year this compare to 810 000 y in the s they can sell their time for about 1 1 million compared to 2 6 million in the s rimsat will launch their satellite on proton to get the best price they bought in bulk they have the right to twelve launch so if any of you need lift can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russian which is being moved into place now tidbit sternberg say this kind of thing ha to be done by entrepreneur not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launch are self insured the promise to replace failed launch within 9 month major investor in rimsat include russell 20 20 which is huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is big telecom business in southeast asia and fund operated by some of the big name in s aerospace which he say is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really take off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren used to seeing russia a anything but an unvarying monolith italy get new government every two week but we don worry because we re used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really go on in russia we won worry about their stability a much part of the problem with cooperative venture is the problem of transfering money the central bank ha policy of taking hard currency payment putting 25 in their coffer and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in ruble to get around this rimsat pay their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that the only the contractor get swindled by the government one of the big problem rimsat ha had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellite which wa rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellite is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellite have lifetime of about 5 year while the more modern express satellite compare well with western technology and last about 8 year while this is much shorter than 15 year for western satellite sternberg downplayed the difference at these price they can afford to launch new one in addition shorter lifetime mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware josh hopkins jbh55289 uxa cso uiuc edu

24731 sctc com boebert sctc com earl boebert writes let say you have scanned image of line drawing in this case boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have set of reference point whose true y position are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon excellent digitize program that is you use program which convert cursor position to y and save those value when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point value that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant way from the known true value this is understandable because the scanned drawing is reproduction of the original and there are successive source of distortion such a differential expansion and contraction of paper error introduced in the printing process scanner error and what have you the error are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustment such a stretching contracting uniformly over or or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is doe any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if have three set of point reference y the known true value distortedreference y the same point with known error distorteddata y other point with unknown error what function of reference and distorted could apply to distorteddata to remove the error suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference point a resulting from the projection of bumpy 3d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the error in the other data point it help to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least reasonable model of the class of distortion below is very short description of the process which we use if you have further question feel free to poke me via mail assume locally smooth distortion 0 compute the delaunay triangulation of your y point this defines the set of neighbor for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edge on the convex hull consider deleting these edge 1 now there are two goal move the distorteddata y to the reference y keep the length a measured from the current y a close a possible to the digitizedlength a measured using the digitized y 2 for every point compute displacement based on and for example for y point for which you know the reference y you can move alpha0 reference y current y this will slowly move the distortedreference y towards the reference y for all other point examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacement and move the point alpha1 sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh 3 iterate 2 until you are happy for example no point move very much alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference y e do you absolutely insist on the final point exactly matching the reference or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against change in length of the edge warning there are couple of geometric invariant which must be observed essentially you can allow the convex hull to change and you can allow triangle to fold over neighboring triangle both of these can be handled either by special case check on the motion of individual point or by periodically re triangulating the point using the current position but still calculating digitizedlength from the original position when we first did this the triangulation time wa prohibitive so we only did it once if were motivated to try and change code that ha been working in production mode for 5 year might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear

part 1 second sign the noble messenger saw declared his prophethood and presented to humanity decree a the glorious qur an and manifest miracle which number according to the scholar one thousand the occurrence of those miracle in their entirety is a certain a the fact that he declared himself prophet in fact a shown by the word of the most obstinate unbeliever quoted in various place of the wise our an even they could not deny the occurrence of his miracle but only called them hasha wa kella allah forbids sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their follower the miracle of muhammad saw have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema scholar of islam to the hundreth degree the miracle is the conformation by the creator of the universe of his declaration of prophethood it ha the effect of the word you have indeed spoken the truth suppose that you said in the assembly of ruler while being observed by him the true ruler ha appointed me to such and such position at time when you were asked to prove your claim the word yes uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you or if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word yes in the same way allah most noble messenger claimed am the envoy of the creator of this universe my proof is that he will change his unbroken order at my request and my prayer now look at my finger he make them run like fountain with five spigot look at the moon by gesture of my finger he split it in two look at that tree to affirm me and to bear witness to me it move and come near to me look at this food although it is barely enough for two or three men it satisfies two or three hundred further he show hundred of similar miracle however the evidence of the veracity of this high being and the proof of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracle all his deed and act his word and behavior his moral conduct and manner his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness indeed many people such a abdullah salam the famous scholar of the child of israel came to belief merely by seeing him and said no lie can hide in this face nor can any fraud be found in it although many of the researcher have concluded that the proof of the prophethood of muhammad and his miracle number about one thousand there are thousand perhaps hundred of thousand of proof of his prophethood and hundred of thousand of truth seeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinion have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of way the wise our an alone demonstrates thousand of the proof of his prophethood in addition to it own forty aspect of miraculousness since prophethood is a phenomenon of humanity and hundred of thousand of individual who claimed prophethood and performed miracle have lived and passed away then the prophethood of muhammad saw is of certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others for whatever evidence quality and attribute became the mean of the prophethood and messengership of all the messenger such a jesus a and moses a they are all owned in more perfect and comprehensive fashion by muhammad saw and since the cause and mean of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of muhammad saw this authority is to be found in

stupidity and lie now before everyone get crazy with me let me say that koresh wa crazy a bed bug but out government wa crazier and they lied to u they told u compound had been under survaillance for quite some time yet whoever wa watching the place failed to see that koresh went jogging and into town on regular basis everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn pick him up then there are two possible answer first they didn see him what kind of survaillance is that second they didn care they wanted confrontation they wanted publicity and they got it after the first battle they told u that they did not know he knew they were coming they also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that well we know now that they intercepted the informant call and went in anyway did they explore all of the possibility for ending the seige according to them they did but according to the hartford courant the woman that raised koresh his grandmother wa not allowed to go in and see him the fbi agent who she spoke with wa bob rick and according to the paper he said lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out his grandmother raised vernon howell koresh real name she didn raise david koresh someone who raise you and love you doe not speak to you strickly on logical level there is also an emotional level on which they can reach you here another one all during this operation the fbi ha been claiming that they feared mass suicide and that is one of the reason that something must be done now they claim they never thought he would do it knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this wa costing that wa the start of the justification part part of the plan that when knew it would come soon but back to the plan it is considered cruel and unusal punishment to execute criminal in the mind of many people but look at what acceptable they knew the parent adult had gas mask they did not know or were not sure if the child had them so the plan wa to pour the gas into the compound the mother seeing what the gas wa doing to their child were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with spent two year in the army and like everyother veteran went through cbr chemical biological radiological warfare training part of that training is going into room filled with the same stuff that the child were subjected to to make the stuff really interesting the gas also ha chemical agent that irritates the skin you think it on fire have no doubt the child would become hysterical it not the kind of thing you never want to do again this wa the plan the final solution we waited 444 day for our hostage to come home from iran we gave these people 51 day stated on several occasion that there wa absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to a success well fbi agent rick changed my mind again newclip from the hartford courant and while expressing regret at the loss of life he suggested that the operation had been at least modified success because not single federal shot had been fired and not single federal agent had been hurt it took 17 dead child to get u that new definition of success one more thought the government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapon on the premise he had license for the 50 caliber machine gun they knew damn well he had one they also knew he had it legally still without the element of surprise they sent in agent to get him for all of this my president take full responsibility what guy

were inspired leave you it will be some time before post again with the following thought authored by eugene england professor of english at brigham young university mr england wrote the following a part of book review section in this people magazine spring 1993 edition conclude with little sermon because believe we will not be mormon or human family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with term like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative christian or non christian hal 8 when we are tempted to draw circle around set of belief and tradition and style and call it american then exclude those who don fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of good american might be one who doesn draw exclusive circle that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central american ideal is by excluding others and when we are tempted to draw circle around mormon or christian to decide who is orthodox and who isn by how much they agree with u it might be well to consider that the central pillar of christ orthodoxy is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family recently spent some time in christian bookstore in california the service wa excellent the clerk and customer all smiling neat and well scrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offering of scriptural commentary sentimental fiction and collection of evangelistic sermon but wa dismayed to find how much shelf space wa given to attacking others often viciously whether the political left our modern american culture or other religion whole section wa devoted to cult and the occult and a you might expect mormonism wa right there under the same rubric and indictment often by the same author a satanism and found could either rent or buy in english or spanish copy of the god maker that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous anti mormon film that us exaclty the same technique and even accusation of the nazi film that scapegoated jew in the 1930s it seems to me one major indication that person is genuine convert to christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety perfect love casteth out fear john 4 18 have always been pleased that the lds church ha not engaged in attack on other faith though find disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormon to engage in the same kind of stereotyping and scapegoating and even threat of coercive action a the religious right wing ha launched this year against the political left and american cultural and religious style they don like it is fearful irony that in so doing mormon take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked mormon people who would if they had power forcefully restrict mormon right along with those of others they believe to be evil the above sermon wa addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe to this people magazine but would certainly apply to all of u who rely on the mercy and grace of jesus christ to bring u back into his arm even though the lds church claim devine authority to exercise the principle of the restored gospel a in the day of christ the church doe not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the church for one do not wish to be labelled christian if those who profess themselves a christian attack my belief because they are intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret biblical scripture of the same source to have different meaning and implication than mainstream christianity would give it once again being in the majority doe not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective voice is louder that really all the critic of the lds church have to stand on in term of the kind of biblical interpretation used a proof to counter the lds church interpretation using someone el biased research of truth

21409 ennews ea asu edu guncer enuxha ea asu edu selim guncer writes you might not like what bernard lewis writes about label him a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statement about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said edward said by the way is christian not muslim think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other country like the u prior to the civil war he also doe not conceal that there are verse in the quran which promote the liberation of slave what he doesn and don think nobody can deduce from these verse is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic country now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslim but the fact are out there also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being zionist to what wrote regarding bernard lewis him being zionist give him political motive for his giving misrepresentation and half truth about islam read orientalism by edward said see the evidence for yourself in fact may post some of it here if it isn too long they were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access that slavery wa abolished at certain date some 1200 year after muhammed that this wa the cause of tension in the ottoman empire between the arab slave trader and the government etc we also have in the asu library volume of british document on slavery where report and document concerning slavery all around the world can be found which checked some of the incident lewis mention so don think one political stance ha anything to do with documentary evidence haven read lewis article so can comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writing _in general_ so far that his political motif make him biased writer on islam his anti islamic polemic a understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half truth again read orientalism by edward said am _not_ asking you to take what say on trust in fact am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is well known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ the issue raised wa that slave were used for sexual purpose when it wa claimed that islam prohibits extra marital sex wrote that the prophet himself had concubine wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary to the notion that sex is for procreation only in other word such claim are baseless in the quran and the hadith if slavery is _in reality_ a opposed to in the practice of some muslim opposed by islam then using slave for sexual purpose is necessarily opposed too seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you islam is not advocating slavery slavery wa an existing institution in the 7th century it advised on slave being freed for good deed etc which is nothing new many culture saw this a good thing what is the problem here but can argue rightfully that slave were discouraged about thinking about their status politically the quran reward the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day you ll be free but it is very understandable that do not communicate with muslim since they assume the quran is from god and think it is rule based system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo slave are part of this system the subordination of woman so that their function in society boil down to child making is part of this system etc understand your point of view selim think rather it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ some of the point you repeat above have already answered before regarding woman have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not anti woman etc however have you been completely ignoring my posting or just missing them just reposted very good one under the title islam and woman reposted from soc religion islam if this ha already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and will email you copy of this excellent article imho your understanding of the issue of woman in islam is sadly deficient regarding slave _my_ posting on slavery the second one made which is repost of an article wrote early last year is based completely on the qur an and contains numerous qur anic verse and hadith to support it point of view our approach are different you are arguing from historical standpoint and am arguing directly from the teaching of the qur an and hadith now just because people say they are muslim and perform particular action doe that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the qur an and sunnah no of course not let me give you concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur an prohibits drinking now if person say am muslim and then proceeds to drink bottle of beer doe this now mean that islam teach that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it is very natural to think that the author author of the quran had no idea that the socio economic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shift in 1400 year in the western culture first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well rule have changed and the status quo ha driven muslim country into misery trying to survive in heathen world muslim country have failed economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rule in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering place you are judging islam here on capitalist term capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption is in opposition to islamic teaching to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking islam doe not pretend to be capitalist and doe not try to be capitalist this doe not mean that islam doe not support free market for it doe in general but there are other part of capitalism which are opposed to islam a understand it when this stopped you and were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour no capital no industry very poor social service the education level in muslim country are the lowest in the world the health statistic are miserable etc one can postulate numerous reason for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim will give you clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your view if you think a you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for large part of history the islamic world wa very powerful for significant section of history the islamic world wa the foremost in the science so to say that islam is for example anti education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam history show that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reason for this situation you blame muslim for not following the quran but blame muslim for following the quran well selim your viewpoint on woman in islam make me question the extent of your knowledge of islam really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslim are following the qur an or not your idea is baseless from historical fact it is poor utopia the islamic world wa at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it is by following the qur an that muslim are backwards in education selim it is _your_ thesis that is anti historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory while my idea are derived from social and economic history you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being anti education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your view make me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this my solution to all muslim is simple cut the crap think selim you should consider taking your own advice get the fact straight here too and work hard to reverse the effect of 1300 year of ignorance selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslim being leader of science till about 1400 or so think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history selim if remember right you say in one of your earlier post that you are an apostate from islam think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issue and start _reading_ some of our posting about islam rather than ignoring them a you so

ve read make very convincing case none of this sound like urban legend to me irving notoriously unreliable historian say that funk the nazi finance minister wa homosexual he give no source know next to nothing about irving and nothing about funk what precisely do you know that would contradict all of the other history book that have read concerning the existence of homosexual nazi are you trying to say that all historian are taking part in an anti homosexual smear what about homosexual writer who agree with the official history don you think they would have found out the truth by now if roehm and heines were not homosexual would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism no one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexual in any case challenge anyone to document this claim if you are going to challenge all historian on this point not just irving then the burden of proof is on you track down the reference find out where the story originate from again you are the one in germany close to archival material most people on the net are not have found great deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexual among the nazi this seems to include all of the worst one hitler himmler goebbels goering heydrich eichmann and many more eh what is your agenda here to prove that the nazi were heterosexual so that you can bash heterosexual doe it bother you that some of the nazi might have been homosexual doe this make all homosexual bad if this is true of course not and what about bisexual are they half nazi don know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazi were homosexual the german officer corp before ww1 for instance wa notorious for it homosexuality there were numerous scandal which rocked the german govt during the late 19th and early 20th century many of the kaiser friend were prosecuted the kaiser wa no homosexual but the germany army had long tradition of tolerating homosexuality going far back into prussian history back to frederick the great at least who wa himself homosexual roehm wa product of this prussian officer tradition and the old german army like the english public school system being well known center of homosexuality would have been quite willing to overlook roehm homosexuality in addition some nazi complained of homosexuality in the hitler youth the hitler youth swallowed up all pre nazi youth group and some of the various pre war vandervogel bund and volkish youth group were known to promote homoerotic ideal and friendship and in many case homosexuality itself so it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual nazi regardless of the official nazi dogma concerning the evil of homosexuality why should this suprise anyone homosexuality ha always existed in all society it would be most unusual if the nazi were an exception no don have any source for you a think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citation from archival material and do not have access to these nor do intend to reread every book on the nazi and on modern homosexuality that have ever read don have the time nothing is stopping you however from chasing down those source

would be consciously intellectually dishonest though am not can you show me anything that would lead you to think otherwise see the spreading christianity thread in which he say ignore certain statement that specifically acknowledged and dean did not he called them the great commission but this is not descriptive of jesus word in matt 10 15 matt 10 14 jerusalem bible translation and if anyone doe not welcome you or listen to what you have to say a you walk out of the house or town shake the dust from your foot matt 10 15 tell you solemnly on the day of judgment it will not go a hard with the land of sodom and gomorrah a with that town in the post to which dean is referring above said the above is good description of kaflowitz who keep harping on shaking the dust off the foot but ignoring what christ said next the highlighted word refer to matt 10 14 and 10 15 respectively and dean countered actually this comment of your is perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are since specifically acknowledged the great commission and the entreaty to spread the word in fact it is the combination of the two statement wa addressing and not just the one and for you to characterize that a ignoring the instruction to spread the word is good example of what dishonest little fellow you are of course matt 10 15 quoted above make no mention of instruction to spread the word all these quote btw are from message id 1993apr13 121624 3400 cbnewsj cb att com in which at the end he claim did not answer question which answered and which he deleted to get the chronology right he deleted the answer and then said didn answer and claim it correctly because my question went do you too measure the goodness of post by it entertainment value and care not whit for such mundane thing a truth and falsehood and the closest dean came to an answer wa peter peter peter you re just so stupid pretentious dull and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is of course this doe not answer my question which ha to do with post in general and not my post in particular surely even dean know this yet he brazenly asserts otherwise reinforcing his claim with an insult so now restore the answer to your question that you deleted if you re still unable to figure it out ask nice kid at the local junior high to help you it really doesn take much sophistication to understand on top of which doubt that the answer is at all representative of dean true frame of mind the insult you have seen quoted thus far are but small sample of the stream that ooze out of dean mind throughout the 284 line post from which these quote were taken one wonder whether dean mind is so warped a to find sport in all this he even dredge up falsified account of event that transpired earlier on another thread you made an as of yourself by claiming that it wa in the tradition of lent to make public announcement of the sin of other individual false said it wa the tradition to recall and atone for one sin that made public announcement of the sin of others sin btw that were matter of public record documented in the post of others is different matter many of the individual involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see a sin what morally upright people see a sin so pointed some of them out and expressly set up whole thread your turn to let people point out my sin to me dean again you made an as of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah wa somehow an attempt to paint jew a plaster saint thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion a well a showing your dislike for people saying positive thing about jew and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made and then claiming am ignoring the very argument acknowledge actually what happened wa that dean made it seem like any jew who gave alms or did other act of charity in public wa hypocrite according to jewish custom in doing so he wa caricaturing jewish custom a being almost impossibly demanding a well a implicitly slandering all jew who make public their act of charity went very easily on dean for this giving him the benefit of the doubt in post following my initial crack about plaster saint suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording in an astonishing act of ingratitude dean now serf up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between u and using it a the basis of one insult after another peter nyikos',\n",

saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini is scheduled for launch aboard titan iv centaur in october of 1997 after gravity assist of venus earth and jupiter in vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004 upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuver to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separate from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relay the probe data to earth for about 3 hour while the probe enters and traverse the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and half year titan synchronous orbit trajectory will allow about 35 flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objective of the mission are threefold conduct detailed study of saturn atmosphere ring and magnetosphere conduct close up study of saturn satellite and characterize titan atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspect of titan is the possibility that it surface may be covered in part with lake of liquid hydrocarbon that result from photochemical process in it upper atmosphere these hydrocarbon condense to form global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan cloud and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiment aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical process that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini 1625 1712 the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturn satellite and the major division in it ring the titan atmospheric entry probe is

astronomer and astrophysicist claim to be looking for unified field theory in which all of the force of the universe can be explained with single set of law or equation but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 year the late physicist dewey larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he call the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimension in discrete unit and in two reciprocal form space and time 2 the physical universe conforms to the relation of ordinary commutative mathematics it magnitude are absolute and it geometry is euclidean from these two postulate larson developed complete theoretical universe using various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motion the concept of in ward and out ward scalar motion and speed in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson wa able to match object in his theoretical universe with object in the real physical universe photon sub atomic particle incomplete atom charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar etc even object not yet discovered then such a exploding galaxy and gamma ray burst and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson wa able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his book book of dewey larson the following is complete list of the late physicist dewey larson book about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early book are out of print now but still available through inter library loan the structure of the physical universe 1959 the case against the nuclear atom 1963 beyond newton 1964 new light on space and time 1965 quasar and pulsar 1971 nothing but motion 1979 9 50 substitute for the 8 3 billion super collider the last four chapter explain chemical bonding the neglected fact of science 1982 the universe of motion 1984 final solution to most all astrophysical mystery basic property of matter 1988 all but the last of these book were published by north pacific publisher o box 13255 portland or 97213 and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn have each of them several of them including the last one are available from the international society of unified science isus 1680 atkin ave salt lake city utah 84106 this is the organization that wa started to promote larson theory they have other related publication including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey larson background physicist dewey larson wa retired engineer chemical or electrical he wa about 91 year old when he died in may 1989 he had bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop way to compute chemical property based only on the element used larson lack of fancy ph degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist are ignoring him but it is not valid reason sometimes it take relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the tree at the same time it is clear from his book that he also knew orthodox physic and astronomy a well a any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction ad hoc assumption principle of impotence in consistency etc larson did not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it wa not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various part of his theory with other researcher experimental and observational data and in many case his explanation fit better self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicist and astronomer have they claim to be looking for unified field theory that work but have been ignoring one for over 30 year now modern physic doe not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of larson book are full of quotation of leading orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank meyer professor emeritus of uw superior wa is strong proponent of larson theory and wa or still is president of larson organization the international society

texas or anywhere else it would be gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicist don realize it but according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey larson a described in his book the strange goofy particle meson hyperon alleged quark etc which they are finding in existing collider fermi lab cern etc are really just atom of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they are incompatible with their environment larger and more expensive collider will only create few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not seen there before and the physicist will be even more confused than they are now are few more type of anti matter atom worth the 8 3 billion cost don we have much more important us for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas ha serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ant eating the insulation off underground cable how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be required to keep the ant out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon a proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it ha more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which larson call unit velocity and the natural datum in larson theory positron is actually particle of matter not anti matter when positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they are made neutralize each other in larson theory the anti matter half of the physical universe ha three dimension of time and only one dimension of space and exists in reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury ha been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance are attributed via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet venus earth jupiter etc the remaining 43 second of arc are being used to help prove einstein general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey larson achieved result closer to the 43 second than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his book he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity a another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the part about mass increase near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift greater than 1 000 really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from u in time in larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension are negligible but at high speed they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increase it ha been proven in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass f orthodox physicist are ignoring the third factor force in larson theory mass stay constant and force drop toward zero force is actually motion or combination of motion or relation between motion including inward and outward scalar motion the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey larson 1984 north pacific publisher o box 13255 portland oregon 97213 456 page indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portion of general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty year ago it contains final solution to most all astrophysical mystery including the formation of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true origin of the 3 degree background radiation cosmic ray and gamma ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf exploding galaxy etc it contains what astronomer and astrophysicist are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open mind the following is an example of his theory success in his first book in 1959 the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxy several year before astronomer started finding them they are necessary consequence of larson comprehensive theory and when quasar were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray burst astro physicist and astronomer are still scratching their head about the mysterious gamma ray burst they were originally thought to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit ha been detecting them in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any known object except for few case of directional coincidence gamma ray burst are necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey larson according to page 386 of his book the universe of motion published in 1984 the gamma ray burst are coming from supernova explosion in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson call the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source location of the burst do not correspond with known object and come from all direction uniformly wonder how close to u in space source location would have to be for gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinction of the past which are now being blamed on impact of comet and asteroid were actually caused by nearby gamma ray burst larsonian binary star formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star system are actually likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey larson will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter 7 of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other book first of all according to larson star do not generate energy by fusion small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the complete annihilation of heavy element heavier than iron each element ha destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit star internal temperature increase a it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of iron there is type supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his book better than can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at le than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star wa already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for while over long period of time both mass start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now start to form red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time start to form white dwarf star both star then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the r diagram the chance of the two mass falling back into the exact same location in space making single lone star again are near zero they will instead form binary system orbiting each other according to larson white dwarf star ha an inverse density gradient is densest at it surface because the material at it center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasy about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf star revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by it heat etc these will become planet in chapter 7 of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principle of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode law black hole fantasy heard that physicist stephen hawking recently completed theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merging together into single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black hole such result should be recognized by everyone a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black hole etc after reading physicist dewey larson book about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black hole are nothing more than mathematical fantasy the strange object at cygnus 1 is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory by the way do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be acting a if hawking severe physical problem somehow make him wiser it doe not wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey larson while he wa still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson theory book and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion heard of that concept many year ago in connection with ufo and unorthodox inventor but never wa able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed found possible clue about why they might work on page 112 113 of the book basic property of matter by the late physicist dewey larson which describes part of larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe quote one paragraph a indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find are derived from the environment it wa brought out in volume larson book nothing but motion that there are physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron are in many case absorbed by atomic structure the opportunity for utilizing this type of motion in such structure are limited it follows that there is always large excess of free electron in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electron cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating unit of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate are thus exposed to flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there are other process to be discussed later whereby electron are returned to the environment the electron population of material aggregate such a the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson theory uncharged electron are also massless and are basically photon of light of particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light according to larson theory might have the above and below label mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass le un charged electron flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps giving them charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson theory an electrical charge is one dimensional rotational vibration of particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give clue to confused meteorologist about how and why lightning is generated in cloud suppression of larsonian physic the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey larson ha been available for more than 30 year published in 1959 in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science or physic or astronomy etc a well a the scientific literature and the education system to totally ignore larson theory ha they have larson theory ha excellent explanation for many thing now puzzling orthodox physicist and astronomer such a gamma ray burst and the nature of quasar larson theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physic chemistry and astronomy journal in the s and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of larson theory should be included in all related course at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that student are not kept in the dark about worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source especially larson book un

watson molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore molecular biology of the cell for starter remember the question wa posed in theological context why doe god cause disease in newborn and my answer is likewise from theological perspective my own it is no le valid than purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspective often fail to fulfil this criterion think you misread my meaning said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesn mean it perfect now it ha certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite few reference that support your assertion your assertion is le valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it ha been claimed that parasite and disease are perhaps more important than we ve thought for instance sex might have evolved a defence against parasite this view is supported by computer simulation of evolution eg tierra perhaps thought it wa higher energy ray like ray gamma ray and cosmic ray that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that doe most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of u know what the atmosphere wa like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologist do not claim that life began 4 billion year ago after all that would only be half billion year or so after the earth wa created it would still be too primitive to support life seem to remember figure more like 2 5 to 3 billion year ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with better estimate d replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimate of the age of the earth range between 4 6 4 8 billion year and earliest sign of life not true fossil but organic stromatolite like layer date back to 3 5 billion year this would leave more than billion year for the first cell to evolve m sorry can give any reference this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry attended here dominion it wa no great feat for satan to genetically engineer disease both bacterial viral and genetic although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration can understand scott reaction excuse me but this is so far fetched that know you must be jesting do you know what pathogen are do you know what point mutation are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it a fact but you cannot know that hope you don forget this we have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one doe not have to _believe_ in anything it is healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one own conclusion prior to this theology doe not use this method therefore seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusion human dna being more complex tends to accumulate error adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is bad combination hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial disease disorder you are supposing purpose not valid move bacteria and virus do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifest of general principle of evolution only replication save replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the le efficient method didn make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary process some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade haven seen much evidence for either claim but then ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john question of why why are there genetic disease and why are there so many bacterial and viral disease which require baby to develop antibody is it god fault the original question say no it is not of course nothing evil is god fault but your explanation doe not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you don know that satan is not responsible and neither do suppose that powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill that affect mankind don think so he could have done much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any disease they are just a inevitable a any product of evolution did say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you ve done is to oversimplify what said to the point that your summary of my word take on new context never said that people are meant presumably by god to be punished by getting disease why did say is that free moral choice have attendent consequence if mankind chooses to reject god a people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse event in an entropic universe am not expecting this if god exists expect him to leave u alone would also like to hear why do you believe your choice are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not a clear cut a it seems to be what consequence would you expect from rejecting allah oh admit it not perfect yet but m working on it good library or bookstore is good starting point what doe this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subject and important scientific endeavor but they explain how god created and set up life process they don explain the why behind creation life or it subsequent evolution why is there why behind and your proposition wa something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these book is there any need to invoke any why behind prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention a recent cosmological theory hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty detail of biology and genetics although m sure d find it fascinating subject for realize that the detail do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to it environment m sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no

nothing new had seen much the same in other typical christian anti gay sentimental literature gay people are and will con tinue to be persecuted a long a such propaganda petpetuates you may be unaware of all the statistica finding concerning african american that have been published and used by various group to re enforce their own bias against african american we usually think of the kkk in these instance but there are many other group of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such finding and document today but that wa not always the case fortunately african american had white who supported their cause and public sentiment wa eventually if not entirely turned around there wa even civil war and anti negro sentiment increased in fact until law were put in place to protect the inalienable right of black it wa pretty much legal to discriminate against them know many gay and will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination you may think that have been deceived or something that is your perogative my church christian church disciple of christ openly affirms the right of oppressed people of all segment of society including gay we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciple we believe in the lord great commandment to love and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popular to do so really like my church for last reason the most can find church almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the gospel and belief in the commandment of love though m hard pressed to find many who actually sho love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especially within their own community may have lost face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my belief but so did the abolitionist against the oppression of african american many were even killed and treated a runaway slave for being nigger lover and such guess ve decided the challenge is worth it in my talk with gay men and woman have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriage wife and husband who are straight who have been hurt in the process etc funny thing is don know of one case where the parent ex wife or even child have continued to reject their gay family member son daughter ex husband father etc after they began to take part in some form of support group like pflag m apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people a louis sheldon from the tradition value coalition have been actively working in the christian underground to garner support within several 8 believe state this coming november for more oppressive legisation against gay perhaps you don get it and maybe you never will many didn get it in the middle age and the proclaimed god will be done a they massacred thousand in witch hunt and inquisition the message that come through loud and clear by proponent against gay right and against gay in general is that there is strong dislike even hatred for gay whether you want to call it such or not it doesn change the result the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the final effect of post like that of yours and mr hudson is that you have conditional love for gay condition change and we ll love you this is sure strange coming from group who claim that god ha an unconditional love one that call people just a they are sure there are thing that will naturally change and habit like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be changed through some sort of therapy but then there are thing like left handedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people expectation in the process this coerced conformity cause many people great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper spirituality this is sad but thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis ha to do with something very personal like sexuality taboo subject even today but firmly believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation on thier bedroom it funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression a though it help u maintain sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people are not criminal another interesting thing happened recently very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley here had two of it pastor arrested for self admitted charge of pederasty men having sex with boy this had apparently been going on for some time couple year but since the charge were voluntary and the church worked closely with the police so imagine that wa how they managed to downplay it in the medium how could such thing happen when the church itself ha an ex gay ministry one of my friend recently told me he wa approached by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there and he wa thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner wa not an invitation to attend the ministry these are difficult time we live in but providing hostile environment and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the christian community the result of the passing amendment in colorado ha created an organization who poster are appearing all over colorado called t a g t forget the whole definition off hand but the last part wa against immoral gross homosexual trash and their motto is working for fag free america with an implicit advocation for violence this is sick and it seems to be what you and mr hudson and others are embracing we christian have loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don measure up and constant beratement from organization like the christian research institute while they do have good purpose also their major work seems to be finding new and better way of excluding people the gospel believe is not so negative rather it seek way to include people have several of dr martin book and find them quite helpful especially concerning cult but it seems that cri ha become cult unto itself why don we just stick to the positive and find way to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away whatever

definition of any type of phobe come from phobia an irrational fear of hence homophobe not only in act up meeting the word is apparently in general use now or perhaps it isn in the bible wouldst thou prefer if were to communicate with thou in bilespeak doe an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being spider doe an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who ha phobia will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashings occur because of natural process people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence isn that what said what are you taking issue with here your remark are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs when the member of one generation pas along their trait to subsequent generation homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our specie at least is going nowhere so every time man ha sex with woman they intend to produce child hmm no wonder the world is overpopulated obviously you keep to the monty python song every sperm is sacred and if a you say it ha purpose a mean to limit population growth then it is by your own arguement natural consider the context m talking about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirement of evolution is that member of specie procreate those who don have no purpose in that context another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to survive the participation of both parent is necessary family must exist since homosexual do not reproduce they cannot constitute family since the majority of humankind is part of family homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that is true by your own arguements homosexual would have vanished year ago due to non procreation also the parent from single parent family should put the baby out in the cold now co they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined a to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context mean am talking about evolution the preservation of the specie the fundamental premise of the whole process but it get worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually prefer heterosexual relationship homosexuality is social abberation a well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait there more read the above expect you to have at least ten child by now with the family growing these day sex is le to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no one but more to do with pleasure in pre pill and pre condom day if you had sex there wa the chance of producing child these day is just ain true people can decide whether or not to have child and when soon they will be able to choose it sex but that another arguement so it more of lifestyle decision again by your arguement since homosexual can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not child both are a unnatural a each other yet another non sequitur sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental that homosexual don procreate mean that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose since homosexual have come out the closet and have convinced some policy maker that they have civil right they are now claiming that their sexuality is preference life style an orientation choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is mere choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti social then it is perverse choice they have even le credibility than before they became prominent people are people are people who are you to tell anyone else how to live their life are you god tm if so fancy date here pretty obvious dodge do you really think you ve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement am not telling anyone anything am demonstrating that there are argument against the practice of homosexuality providing it a merely an alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in context even atheist can understand realize of course that this come dangerously close to establishing value and that atheist are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality a homophobic is to ignore some very compelling argument against the legitimization of the homosexual life style but since the charge is only intended to intimidate it really just demogoguery and not to be taken seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive argument for suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this start again crap all your argument are based on outdated ideal likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generation spawned by bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crush his penis either accidently or not both are in deuteronomy m sure your comment pertains to something but you ve disguised it so well can see what where did mention ideal out dated or otherwise your argument are very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute a to why homosexual should be excluded from participation in scouting the reason are the same a those used to restrict them from teaching by their own logic homosexual are deviate social and biological since any adult is role model for child it is incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm in this case harm mean primarily social though that could be extended easily enough you show me anyone who ha

But if you save\\nto a .PRJ file their positions/orientation are preserved.  Does anyone\\nknow why this information is not stored in the .3DS file?  Nothing is\\nexplicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file. \\nI'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have \\nthe format for the .PRJ file?\\n\\nIs the .CEL file format available from somewhere?\\n\\nRych\\n\\n======================================================================\\nRycharde Hawkes\\t\\t\\t\\temail: rych@festival.ed.ac.uk\\nVirtual Environment Laboratory\\nDept. of Psychology\\t\\t\\tTel  : +44 31 650 3426\\nUniv. of Edinburgh\\t\\t\\tFax  : +44 31 667 0150\\n======================================================================\\n\""
